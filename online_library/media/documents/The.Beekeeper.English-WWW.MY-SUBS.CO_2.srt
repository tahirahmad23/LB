1
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:28,216
That's them in there
just like that?

2
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:30,653
Just like that.

3
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,004
I wouldn't go in there
for a day or two.

4
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:36,855
Heard the expression
kick the hornet's nest?

5
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:38,682
I'll stay right here.
Thank you.

6
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,900
Those things scare me to death.

7
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:42,317
They been killing my honey bees.

8
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:44,817
A few days unchecked,

9
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,253
they'll wipe out
the whole colony.

10
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:47,907
What are you gonna do with them?

11
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:49,343
Well, that's between
me and them,

12
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:50,412
if you don't mind.

13
00:03:51,587 --> 00:03:52,631
That's okay.

14
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,894
I understand these things.

15
00:03:57,288 --> 00:03:59,116
I just wanted to thank you

16
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:02,075
for putting up with me,

17
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:05,122
and all of my bees.

18
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:08,014
This place was crabgrass
and weeds,

19
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:09,318
and you brought it back to life.

20
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:11,563
You're a blessing.

21
00:04:13,217 --> 00:04:15,088
No one's ever
taken care of me before.

22
00:04:20,964 --> 00:04:22,008
I'll, uh...

23
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:25,490
Mr. Clay...

24
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:30,974
Come back at suppertime.
Let me feed you.

25
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:40,628
Boss.

26
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:42,108
- You got something, yeah?
- I got one.

27
00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:44,023
I want it. I need it.

28
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:45,503
Hey, put it in my ear.

29
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:48,332
Get this fucking
hippie shit down, please.

30
00:05:50,053 --> 00:05:52,205
United Data Group.
Good afternoon. This is Boyd.

31
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:53,273
How may I help you?

32
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:55,121
Boyd.

33
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:57,341
Uh, hello.
I just got a message saying

34
00:05:57,365 --> 00:05:59,343
that there's a problem
with my computer.

35
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:01,127
<i>Don't you worry.
The message you received</i>

36
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:03,347
<i>is from our United Data Group
antivirus software.</i>

37
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:04,913
<i>It's part of
the software package</i>

38
00:06:04,937 --> 00:06:06,497
<i>that you pre-installed
on your computer.</i>

39
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:08,700
I'm sorry.
I'm not a computer person.

40
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:10,726
What did you say the name
of your product is again?

41
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:20,146
Now, our records show
that you actually

42
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,017
have an older version
on your account.

43
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,629
So what I'm going to need you
to do is uninstall that

44
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:26,413
<i>and install the latest version.</i>

45
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:28,328
Well, I have no idea
how to do that.

46
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:29,895
My daughter set up
everything for me.

47
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,505
<i>Well, I would recommend</i>

48
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:32,854
<i>you take your computer
to an IT specialist.</i>

49
00:06:32,878 --> 00:06:34,421
However, keep in mind

50
00:06:34,445 --> 00:06:36,423
that you will lose
all your data,

51
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:38,710
since they'll have to replace
the hard drive.

52
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:41,496
I'm pretty remote out here.

53
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,476
Everything I have
is on the computer.

54
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,086
<i>Okay. There is actually</i>

55
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,827
<i>a software package
that you can download</i>

56
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:51,133
that would allow me
to reinstall remotely.

57
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:54,160
All right.
Tell me what to do.

58
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,009
It's okay. Can you, uh,
can you type this,

59
00:06:57,033 --> 00:07:00,055
Friendly friend dot net?

60
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,144
<i>Spelled just how it sounds.</i>

61
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:05,017
Okay. I'm there.

62
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,453
And there should be a button

63
00:07:06,477 --> 00:07:07,541
on your screen
that says "install."

64
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:08,890
<i>Can you click on that button?</i>

65
00:07:08,914 --> 00:07:10,762
I clicked the button.

66
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:12,024
So you're about
to see some windows

67
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:13,504
open, close on your desktop,

68
00:07:13,528 --> 00:07:15,593
<i>as I reinstall
the virus shield for you.</i>

69
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:18,663
Okay.

70
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:20,728
I hope you fucking clowns
are paying attention.

71
00:07:20,752 --> 00:07:21,971
You stick to the script,

72
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,604
but not so much that you sound
like a Goddamn robot.

73
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:27,822
All right?

74
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:30,521
She has got
10K checking,

75
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:33,437
life insurance annuity,
Roth IRA,

76
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:34,699
teacher's pension and...

77
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:37,310
Holy fucking shit!

78
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:39,138
All right.

79
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:41,270
She is a signatory

80
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,317
on a $2 million dollar account.

81
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:47,451
Some, uh...
It's some fucking charity.

82
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:50,845
All right, kids,
let the strip mining begin.

83
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:54,632
Ooh.
My computer's going crazy.

84
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:56,503
<i>Totally normal.</i>

85
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:57,807
<i>Just do not touch your keyboard.</i>

86
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:06,513
Because of this inconvenience,

87
00:08:06,537 --> 00:08:07,993
I'm going to credit back
your subscription fees.

88
00:08:08,017 --> 00:08:09,168
How about that?

89
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:11,344
I've gone ahead
and deposited $500

90
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:13,283
into the account ending 020.

91
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:15,522
Oh, that's not my account.

92
00:08:15,546 --> 00:08:17,263
That's an account that I manage.

93
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:18,743
Can you log into that account

94
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:20,527
and verify the transfer,
please, Miss Parker?

95
00:08:22,074 --> 00:08:24,444
Just hold on.

96
00:08:24,468 --> 00:08:26,296
Yes, there's...

97
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:30,537
There's a transfer for $50,000?

98
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:35,542
Set the hook with sympathy.

99
00:08:35,566 --> 00:08:37,176
Miss Parker, I...

100
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:39,546
I made a terrible mistake.

101
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,069
<i>I was supposed
to credit you 500,</i>

102
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:42,921
<i>but I don't know,
I got a stuck key here.</i>

103
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:45,271
<i>I'm gonna lose my job here.</i>

104
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:48,076
I got kids.

105
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,425
I ain't got fucking kids.

106
00:08:50,886 --> 00:08:53,517
Oh, I don't want you
to get in trouble, but...

107
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:57,608
I could wire the amount back.

108
00:08:57,632 --> 00:09:01,481
I will need
a different password though.

109
00:09:01,505 --> 00:09:02,917
One second.

110
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:06,162
This is the master password
for all her accounts.

111
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:11,143
Okay, so the second we get it,
we zero out everything.

112
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,169
Um...

113
00:09:15,737 --> 00:09:17,608
You know, I, um...

114
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,656
I think
I should call the bank. Hm?

115
00:09:22,091 --> 00:09:23,372
<i>You know what?
You're probably right.</i>

116
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,008
But there goes my job,

117
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,315
and there goes all your data.

118
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:39,978
All my kids' pictures
are on this computer.

119
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:44,592
Okay.

120
00:09:49,684 --> 00:09:51,270
Boom! Fucking yes!

121
00:09:51,294 --> 00:09:53,925
That is what
I am talking about! Come on!

122
00:09:55,603 --> 00:09:58,059
Let me fucking hear it!
I fucking love you people!

123
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,408
I fucking love you!

124
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:04,742
Hello?

125
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:06,701
Hello? You still there?

126
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:16,580
Uh-oh.

127
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,933
Oh.

128
00:10:28,113 --> 00:10:29,288
Oh.

129
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:49,004
What did I do?

130
00:10:49,874 --> 00:10:51,852
Stupid...

131
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,721
Mrs. Parker?

132
00:11:59,727 --> 00:12:00,989
Don't move.

133
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:03,731
Don't you fucking move.

134
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:05,645
Drop the knife.

135
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,781
Hands behind your back.

136
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,657
Slowly get on your knees
one knee at a time.

137
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:26,773
Now, who the fuck are you...

138
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:28,906
...and what are you doing
in my mother's house?

139
00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:33,238
Verona...

140
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:36,067
I'm so sorry.

141
00:12:36,894 --> 00:12:38,069
How do you know my...

142
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,727
Mom.

143
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,667
<i>Until we can clear him,
he's our best and only perp.</i>

144
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:53,104
Clear him?

145
00:12:53,128 --> 00:12:54,496
Agent Parker,
I know that's your mother.

146
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,565
I understand.

147
00:12:56,044 --> 00:12:59,003
But there's a world where
she committed suicide.

148
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,073
Suicide? You can't be serious.

149
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:09,729
That woman loved life
more than anybody I know.

150
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:11,949
But by all means,
let's just completely ignore

151
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:13,994
the big white dude
in her house with a knife.

152
00:13:14,018 --> 00:13:15,193
Get him up.

153
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:16,846
Come on.

154
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:22,418
It's Clay, right?

155
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:24,114
Adam Clay?

156
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:26,746
I don't have much to say.

157
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,269
Mr. Clay, we just got
a couple of questions.

158
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:29,575
Like, what the fuck
were you doing

159
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:30,861
in my mother's house?

160
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:33,472
I was bringing her
a jar of honey.

161
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:36,258
A jar of honey.

162
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:38,869
Who the fuck are you?
Winnie-the-Pooh?

163
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:40,479
I keep bees.

164
00:13:42,264 --> 00:13:43,700
How do you know my mother?

165
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:46,485
I rent some space
in the barn from her.

166
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:48,661
I have a signed lease.

167
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:52,752
But what the fuck
were you doing in her house?

168
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:56,689
She didn't answer
when I knocked.

169
00:13:56,713 --> 00:13:58,019
I noted her car in the driveway.

170
00:13:58,758 --> 00:14:00,369
I heard the smoke alarm
and I entered.

171
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,240
You "noted"?

172
00:14:02,893 --> 00:14:04,333
You got a law enforcement
background?

173
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:06,897
I told you, I take care of bees.

174
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,552
Oh, my God.

175
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:19,230
His hands tested
negative for gunshot residue.

176
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:21,711
But the prints on the gun
were your mother's.

177
00:15:22,842 --> 00:15:24,932
It seems, sadly, it was suicide.

178
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:38,728
Mr. Clay, I need to apologize
for last night.

179
00:15:40,034 --> 00:15:42,297
I realize I may have been
a little aggressive.

180
00:15:45,865 --> 00:15:47,389
That's understandable.

181
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:53,264
Could I interest you
in something a bit stronger?

182
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,833
No.

183
00:15:58,313 --> 00:15:59,836
But I'll sit with you
if you like.

184
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:08,017
No, thank you.

185
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:13,545
I wanted to thank you

186
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:16,374
for taking care of my mom.

187
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,051
I tried to stay in her life
as much as I could.

188
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:22,715
Obviously, I could have
done a better job.

189
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,385
Being old can be a lonely thing.

190
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:33,000
Turn a certain age, you cease
to exist. Cease to matter.

191
00:16:33,652 --> 00:16:36,438
Used to be a part of life,
of the family.

192
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:39,223
Part of the hive,
I guess you could say.

193
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:43,923
There's some British Isles
hiding in your accent.

194
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:47,884
I was born there.

195
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,758
I hated that she was
out here alone.

196
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,805
She wouldn't leave.

197
00:16:59,026 --> 00:17:00,244
There's too many memories.

198
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,771
You know, I think I know
why she liked you.

199
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:07,947
You're just like my brother.

200
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:11,473
He was in MARSOC,
a Marine Raider.

201
00:17:12,343 --> 00:17:14,954
He was killed
a few years ago kicking doors.

202
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,871
She loved him.

203
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,589
He'd mow the lawn

204
00:17:21,613 --> 00:17:24,549
and you'd think
he invented fire.

205
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:26,551
You know, while I graduated
the FBI Academy

206
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:28,751
and she said,
"Oh, that's nice."

207
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,016
She got scammed.

208
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,976
Somebody emptied out
all her accounts,

209
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:39,738
her savings, her retirement.

210
00:17:39,762 --> 00:17:42,741
Got every penny.
Maxed out all her cards.

211
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:44,656
She was an educator,

212
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,682
director of a charity for kids.

213
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:49,380
They got two million
out of that account.

214
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:53,621
You know who did it?

215
00:17:53,645 --> 00:17:55,525
I talked to an agent
in our cyber-crimes office.

216
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,669
This crew's been operating
for two years

217
00:17:57,693 --> 00:17:58,998
and we don't even have names.

218
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:01,412
And even if we did, good luck
building an indictment

219
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:02,654
that would stand up in court.

220
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:05,092
Some defense attorney
would just argue that

221
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:07,355
the elderly victim agreed

222
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,873
to wire a complete stranger
his entire life savings.

223
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:12,205
Taking from an elderly person

224
00:18:12,229 --> 00:18:13,796
is as bad as stealing
from a child.

225
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:16,949
Maybe worse.

226
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:18,801
Someone hurts a child,

227
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,325
there are parents.

228
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:24,067
People who care,
ready to step in.

229
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:27,331
Someone hurts an older person...

230
00:18:29,464 --> 00:18:32,031
sometimes they're left to face
the hornets alone.

231
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,123
Because either
it goes unnoticed...

232
00:18:38,777 --> 00:18:39,996
or no one cares.

233
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,738
I care.

234
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,741
And I'm stubborn.

235
00:18:47,046 --> 00:18:48,265
And so help me God,

236
00:18:48,657 --> 00:18:50,702
I'm going to get these
motherfuckers who did this.

237
00:18:56,665 --> 00:18:58,449
I need to take care of the hive.

238
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:02,801
You've been up all night.

239
00:19:03,628 --> 00:19:05,369
The hive
is more important.

240
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:23,537
What are you doing?

241
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:25,520
- I thought you retired.
<i>- I did.</i>

242
00:19:26,738 --> 00:19:27,913
I need a favor.

243
00:19:28,392 --> 00:19:29,611
<i>What kind of favor?</i>

244
00:19:30,307 --> 00:19:32,266
A name and address.

245
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:35,094
<i>- Easy.</i>
- Not easy.

246
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,750
Even the FBI can't
find these people.

247
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:40,946
Well, we're not the FBI, are we?

248
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,711
<i>Shoot me the deets and stand by.</i>

249
00:19:49,283 --> 00:19:50,695
Yeah.

250
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:52,479
You weren't kidding.
This one kicked my butt.

251
00:19:52,677 --> 00:19:54,046
They're routing
all over the world.

252
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,395
But you found them?

253
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:57,378
Sure.
But who are these people?

254
00:19:58,422 --> 00:19:59,902
I'm gonna find out.

255
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:06,667
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

256
00:20:06,691 --> 00:20:08,345
The hell you think
you're going, pal?

257
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:10,323
This United Data Group?

258
00:20:10,347 --> 00:20:11,740
Don't know nothing about that.

259
00:20:12,262 --> 00:20:14,849
This is private property,
and you're trespassing.

260
00:20:14,873 --> 00:20:16,135
I'm going inside.

261
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:18,660
I'm going to burn it down.

262
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:20,899
Yeah, that's not happening, buddy.

263
00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:22,422
You're not going
any-fucking-where

264
00:20:22,446 --> 00:20:24,381
except right the fuck back
the way you came.

265
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:26,233
Do you know what they do here?

266
00:20:27,364 --> 00:20:29,236
Buddy, I'm counting to three.

267
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:31,586
One, two, three.

268
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,936
There. I did it for you.

269
00:20:36,678 --> 00:20:38,245
You aware
this is a criminal outfit?

270
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:40,614
Scamming the weakest
in our society.

271
00:20:40,638 --> 00:20:42,771
Stealing everything they have.

272
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:44,867
Do you know
that's who you work for?

273
00:20:58,177 --> 00:20:59,657
<i>I'm looking
for the call center.</i>

274
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:01,200
Yeah, you're in the right place.

275
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:02,965
You just have to sign in here.

276
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:09,295
Tell any other companies
in the building

277
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,319
to evacuate now.

278
00:21:11,408 --> 00:21:13,908
- There's going to be a fire.
- Okay. Th...

279
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:14,932
Thanks.

280
00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:21,264
Hang up the phone.

281
00:21:21,288 --> 00:21:23,222
Nah, I'm good, buddy.
I'm just doing my thing here.

282
00:21:25,335 --> 00:21:26,380
Hang up the phone.

283
00:21:26,858 --> 00:21:30,360
Uh, Miss Perkins, so sorry,
I'll have to

284
00:21:30,384 --> 00:21:32,255
- call you right back.
- Everyone...

285
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,606
I need your attention, please.

286
00:21:36,346 --> 00:21:37,346
Repeat after me.

287
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:41,066
I will never steal from the weak

288
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,154
and the vulnerable again.

289
00:21:44,311 --> 00:21:46,201
I sent you
a department download,

290
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:47,836
and we'll find out
what's going on...

291
00:22:01,676 --> 00:22:02,764
Repeat after me.

292
00:22:03,808 --> 00:22:05,743
I will never steal from the weak

293
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:07,135
and the vulnerable again.

294
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,920
I will never steal
from the weak

295
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:10,554
and the vulnerable again.

296
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:15,037
To help you keep that promise,

297
00:22:16,255 --> 00:22:17,909
I'm gonna burn this place
to the ground.

298
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:22,653
Might be a good time to go home.

299
00:22:23,785 --> 00:22:25,023
Oh, my God!

300
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:26,788
- It's gas!
- Fucking psycho.

301
00:22:28,703 --> 00:22:29,878
It's gas!

302
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:32,533
It's gas! It's gas!

303
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:38,059
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

304
00:22:38,582 --> 00:22:40,279
What the fuck, bro?

305
00:22:41,455 --> 00:22:43,041
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

306
00:22:43,065 --> 00:22:44,066
I'm a beekeeper.

307
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:46,503
I protect the hive.

308
00:22:47,722 --> 00:22:50,028
Sometimes I use fire
to smoke out hornets.

309
00:22:50,594 --> 00:22:53,573
This a multi-million dollar
operation, asshole.

310
00:22:53,597 --> 00:22:55,270
Okay, so you can't come up here,

311
00:22:55,294 --> 00:22:56,731
white-knighting shit.

312
00:23:00,735 --> 00:23:02,737
Will you stomp
his ass out, please?

313
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,861
I got it. You fucking get him.

314
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:22,800
You fucking get him!

315
00:23:32,462 --> 00:23:34,421
Bet you feel
really proud of yourself.

316
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,574
Mister...?

317
00:23:58,009 --> 00:23:59,465
Uh...

318
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:01,535
- Uh, uh, Garnett.
- Mr. Garnett.

319
00:24:03,624 --> 00:24:05,950
I don't care if your friends
here live or die.

320
00:24:05,974 --> 00:24:08,996
The next call
from your little phishing scam

321
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,476
to this call center

322
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,739
will make a spark
across these wires.

323
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:15,157
Given all of
the gasoline fumes in here,

324
00:24:16,898 --> 00:24:17,986
I promise you...

325
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:22,009
anything alive in here won't be.

326
00:24:27,517 --> 00:24:29,582
Uh, guys,
we might want to dip out.

327
00:24:55,545 --> 00:24:57,392
Hey. What's going on?

328
00:24:57,416 --> 00:25:02,049
Uh, let me get flat white,
oat milk, of course,

329
00:25:02,073 --> 00:25:04,008
and, uh, extra shot of espresso.

330
00:25:04,032 --> 00:25:05,575
- Of course, Sir.
- Thank you.

331
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:09,472
Good morning. Did we get
the otoro and the uni in?

332
00:25:09,994 --> 00:25:11,319
- Yes, sure.
- We did?

333
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,084
- Yes.
- Fucking finally. Great.

334
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,935
- Hey, Michaela.
- Yes.

335
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:20,459
It... it came back.
The whole thing. Yeah.

336
00:25:20,483 --> 00:25:22,853
And it's like I can barely
fucking move.

337
00:25:22,877 --> 00:25:24,400
It's all tweaked.

338
00:25:25,532 --> 00:25:27,727
- Oh, those are nice.
- Mmm-hmm.

339
00:25:27,751 --> 00:25:29,555
- Those the new bowls?
- Yeah.

340
00:25:31,189 --> 00:25:33,211
- That's perfect. Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

341
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:40,218
What? I'm in a meeting.

342
00:25:40,242 --> 00:25:41,436
<i>You said
hit me on voice</i>

343
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,568
<i>if there's an emergency.</i>

344
00:25:42,592 --> 00:25:45,029
Okay. Right. Well, uh...

345
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,033
It seems we had
a disgruntled customer.

346
00:25:50,513 --> 00:25:53,144
Uh, I just can't comprehend
why you're bothering me.

347
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:54,798
Just get in touch
with the attorney

348
00:25:54,822 --> 00:25:55,822
and start shoving back.

349
00:25:56,475 --> 00:25:59,783
Well, yeah, I don't think
that legal's gonna help much.

350
00:26:00,436 --> 00:26:02,240
Okay, tell me what the fuck
is going on right now.

351
00:26:02,264 --> 00:26:04,895
This dude just strolls in

352
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,984
saying we're stealing
from people,

353
00:26:07,008 --> 00:26:09,813
<i>and he just tears through
all my security guys,</i>

354
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:13,294
<i>like, fucking tissue paper
and, um...</i>

355
00:26:13,318 --> 00:26:14,318
And what?

356
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,800
And he burns the place
to the ground.

357
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:19,498
<i>Yeah. The call center is gone.</i>

358
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:23,000
<i>I'm standing here staring
at a $30 million building,</i>

359
00:26:23,024 --> 00:26:26,070
it's now
a giant fucking ashtray.

360
00:26:27,245 --> 00:26:28,527
Four people didn't get out.

361
00:26:28,551 --> 00:26:30,050
You're telling me
that this asshole

362
00:26:30,074 --> 00:26:31,312
burnt the entire building down

363
00:26:31,336 --> 00:26:32,686
and dropped four fucking bodies?

364
00:26:33,164 --> 00:26:35,186
Yeah, that's not exactly
a disgruntled customer, is it?

365
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,840
<i>Who did this?
Give me a name right now.</i>

366
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:38,581
Sir, I don't have it.

367
00:26:38,605 --> 00:26:41,801
<i>All the cameras and the drives
burned up in the fire.</i>

368
00:26:41,825 --> 00:26:43,629
He had a hat.

369
00:26:43,653 --> 00:26:45,718
Oh, he had a hat. Okay.

370
00:26:45,742 --> 00:26:47,415
I'm gonna hit you back.
All right?

371
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,137
I got to go big-dog this shit
for a minute.

372
00:26:55,317 --> 00:26:57,101
- Hey, I need to talk to you.
- About what?

373
00:26:57,754 --> 00:26:58,886
What? What? No, nothing.

374
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:01,821
I mean, if I had a friend
who, like, had a call center

375
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:04,171
and someone burned it down,
maybe killed some people,

376
00:27:04,195 --> 00:27:05,893
you could get him, right?

377
00:27:06,545 --> 00:27:07,784
Get him?

378
00:27:07,808 --> 00:27:09,002
Yeah,
like disappear the problem.

379
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:11,526
Come on.

380
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,137
I'll be an hour.

381
00:27:13,161 --> 00:27:15,313
That's way above my pay grade.

382
00:27:15,337 --> 00:27:16,967
You literally ran the CIA,

383
00:27:16,991 --> 00:27:18,577
and you're telling me
you can't just find

384
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:20,057
some guy in Massachusetts?

385
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:21,881
Listen, this sounds
like a job for the police.

386
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,345
I just need a name.

387
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,173
Well, you won't get it from me.

388
00:27:25,913 --> 00:27:28,152
And you keep me
a million miles away

389
00:27:28,176 --> 00:27:29,632
from your metaverse meth lab

390
00:27:29,656 --> 00:27:30,656
or whatever it is.

391
00:27:31,353 --> 00:27:33,331
Yup.

392
00:27:33,355 --> 00:27:34,854
So check it out.

393
00:27:34,878 --> 00:27:36,508
Daddy can't hold your hand
on this one.

394
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:39,293
Uh, this is clearly some kind
of crime of passion,

395
00:27:39,317 --> 00:27:40,468
spur of the moment,

396
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,253
someone snapped, like, whatever.

397
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:43,602
But, uh,
what we're going to do is

398
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:44,864
I'm going to send you
some credentials,

399
00:27:44,888 --> 00:27:46,344
you're going
to log into our cloud

400
00:27:46,368 --> 00:27:47,824
and you're going
to look at anyone connected

401
00:27:47,848 --> 00:27:49,347
to the last few deals
you closed. All right?

402
00:27:49,371 --> 00:27:50,870
<i>Just, I don't know, start there.</i>

403
00:27:50,894 --> 00:27:53,090
And, like,
what if I find this guy?

404
00:27:53,114 --> 00:27:54,308
Then what?

405
00:27:54,332 --> 00:27:56,571
You get a wrecking crew together

406
00:27:56,595 --> 00:27:57,834
and you go <i>Goodfellas</i> on him.

407
00:27:57,858 --> 00:27:59,357
I mean, come on,
you're a connected guy, right?

408
00:27:59,381 --> 00:28:00,445
Do you understand?

409
00:28:02,427 --> 00:28:04,647
Yeah. No, I understand.
I, uh...

410
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:06,214
I'll get it done.

411
00:28:22,273 --> 00:28:23,773
It's called a day off.

412
00:28:24,885 --> 00:28:25,886
<i>V, you good?</i>

413
00:28:26,364 --> 00:28:27,714
Yeah, I'm great. Why?

414
00:28:28,932 --> 00:28:30,612
I mean, you did
lose your mother yesterday.

415
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,721
Yeah.

416
00:28:37,462 --> 00:28:39,136
<i>What do you want, Wiley?</i>

417
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,790
Are you leaving?
Please don't go.

418
00:28:40,814 --> 00:28:42,816
I'm going to yoga.

419
00:28:43,773 --> 00:28:45,533
Remember United Data Group?

420
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:49,997
<i>Go on.</i>

421
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:52,216
You sober enough to drive?

422
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:57,133
Yeah.

423
00:29:00,877 --> 00:29:02,444
Give us a few seconds,
thank you.

424
00:29:04,968 --> 00:29:06,119
Where's mine?

425
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:07,730
It's an old cup from my car

426
00:29:07,754 --> 00:29:09,209
with instant
and gas station hot water.

427
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:10,558
Ew.

428
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,670
- You want a sip?
- No.

429
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,153
So the fire fried
all the CCTV footage.

430
00:29:17,328 --> 00:29:19,306
Receptionist said she saw
some jacked dude in his 40s,

431
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,134
manhandled security
and walked in

432
00:29:21,158 --> 00:29:22,159
with a couple gas cans.

433
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:25,467
This clown car saw everything,
but no one's talking.

434
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:28,533
They're all frequent fliers
with perjury,

435
00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:30,709
fraud and cyber BeEFs.

436
00:29:30,733 --> 00:29:33,867
Fucking scumbags.
I want IDs on all of them.

437
00:29:37,218 --> 00:29:39,499
You know, this is just the tip
of, like, 20 spears, right?

438
00:29:40,525 --> 00:29:41,788
Can I just have this moment?

439
00:29:57,455 --> 00:29:58,848
Eloise Parker.

440
00:29:59,544 --> 00:30:01,479
Yeah, I took her for over
two million yesterday.

441
00:30:01,503 --> 00:30:03,873
She's, uh... she's Black,

442
00:30:03,897 --> 00:30:05,918
widow, just has a daughter
in Boston.

443
00:30:05,942 --> 00:30:08,162
I don't think this is it,
but, you know.

444
00:30:10,381 --> 00:30:13,341
You said your boy
has an old-ass pickup truck.

445
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:15,865
That's him.

446
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,486
What the hell are those?

447
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:31,315
Fucking beehives.

448
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,511
Yeah, dickhead was talking
about them.

449
00:30:33,535 --> 00:30:36,146
I guess he's a, like, bee lover.

450
00:30:37,495 --> 00:30:38,864
You know what?

451
00:30:38,888 --> 00:30:41,867
He breaks my shit,
you break his shit.

452
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,395
Where you at, bee boy?

453
00:31:33,334 --> 00:31:35,423
You fucking hiding, bitch?

454
00:31:36,206 --> 00:31:38,339
Come out and fucking face us!

455
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,523
Bye, bitch, now!

456
00:31:49,306 --> 00:31:50,568
Let's go!

457
00:32:58,288 --> 00:33:00,116
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

458
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:02,814
Can someone,
like, fucking help me?

459
00:33:04,903 --> 00:33:07,230
Fuck.

460
00:33:07,254 --> 00:33:09,125
No! I'm okay.

461
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,193
We can talk about this.

462
00:33:14,217 --> 00:33:15,673
We can talk about this.

463
00:33:15,697 --> 00:33:17,631
Let's just work this out,
me and you. We can fix...

464
00:33:17,655 --> 00:33:19,894
No, no!

465
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,053
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

466
00:33:35,804 --> 00:33:39,175
So, help me understand
because I'm a little confused.

467
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:40,741
What's the nature
of your business?

468
00:33:40,765 --> 00:33:42,874
Don't know nothing
about no business.

469
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:44,441
So then why are people
just wiring you

470
00:33:44,465 --> 00:33:45,920
their entire life savings?

471
00:33:45,944 --> 00:33:48,880
Must be
your winning personality.

472
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:50,012
They got us lawyers,

473
00:33:50,036 --> 00:33:51,665
so maybe
you want to talk to them.

474
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,147
You know, this is a really
nice shirt, by the way.

475
00:33:55,171 --> 00:33:57,323
Did you steal it out
of a casket, you dog fucker?

476
00:33:57,347 --> 00:33:59,064
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh...

477
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:00,544
Verona, if you're done
shitting all over

478
00:34:00,568 --> 00:34:02,111
this gentleman's civil rights,

479
00:34:02,135 --> 00:34:03,745
can I speak to you for a moment?

480
00:34:05,094 --> 00:34:06,313
That's a nice shirt.

481
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:10,752
- V.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

482
00:34:12,145 --> 00:34:13,276
I'm an asshole.

483
00:34:14,364 --> 00:34:16,105
Oh, so you like fires?

484
00:34:16,845 --> 00:34:17,846
Yeah, today I do.

485
00:34:18,412 --> 00:34:20,544
Good, 'cause, uh,
today's your lucky day.

486
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:23,306
'Cause apparently,
your mother's house

487
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,134
is on fire, too,
and some other shit.

488
00:34:25,158 --> 00:34:26,700
- Let's go.
- Wait. What?

489
00:34:26,724 --> 00:34:29,292
Yeah. Shit's on fire.
Let's go.

490
00:34:45,787 --> 00:34:47,223
You good?

491
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,964
V, you okay?

492
00:34:50,313 --> 00:34:51,769
Yeah.

493
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,860
- That's a new one.
- Jesus Christ.

494
00:34:55,884 --> 00:34:58,060
Where's Maggie?
Hey, Maggie, ID?

495
00:35:02,238 --> 00:35:04,632
- United Data Group.
- Well, he's handsome.

496
00:35:05,676 --> 00:35:06,808
Thank you.

497
00:35:09,115 --> 00:35:10,179
Are you okay?

498
00:35:10,203 --> 00:35:12,205
Yeah, Wiley, I'm good.
I'm good.

499
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,184
You think there's
even the remotest chance

500
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:18,100
that the dude who burned down
United Data Group

501
00:35:18,124 --> 00:35:19,318
is the same guy
renting this spot

502
00:35:19,342 --> 00:35:20,343
from your mother?

503
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:25,131
The beekeeper.

504
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,875
I lost my virginity
in that barn.

505
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:42,626
Fucking shit.

506
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:58,009
The universe is going
to have to wait.

507
00:35:58,033 --> 00:35:59,252
I gotta take this.

508
00:36:02,864 --> 00:36:04,537
Yo, what's up, playa?

509
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:05,886
This is the part
where you tell me

510
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,323
what a good job you did,

511
00:36:07,347 --> 00:36:09,934
and I put you on a G6
to Hawaii to chill for a week.

512
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:11,438
I'm so sorry, Mr. Danforth.

513
00:36:12,787 --> 00:36:14,025
Did you fuck this up?

514
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:15,505
Are you fucking crying
right now?

515
00:36:15,529 --> 00:36:19,030
I'm not crying.
I'm bleeding.

516
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:20,988
Bleeding?
Why are you bleeding?

517
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,338
What do you mean, bleeding?

518
00:36:22,362 --> 00:36:26,017
My fingers on my right hand.

519
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,647
He cut them off.

520
00:36:27,671 --> 00:36:30,718
Okay. Fuck off. Go. Go.

521
00:36:32,937 --> 00:36:36,003
He? Who the fuck is he?
Tell me who he is right now.

522
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:40,225
I don't know.
A fucking beekeeper.

523
00:36:40,249 --> 00:36:43,315
<i>Makes honey and
fucks with beehives.</i>

524
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:46,037
He fucks with beehives?
What's he saying about bees?

525
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,102
I don't know.
He said he was, like,

526
00:36:48,126 --> 00:36:50,061
protecting the hive
or something.

527
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:51,932
Oh, fuck, man. What the...

528
00:36:51,956 --> 00:36:53,891
Oh, Jesus Christ!

529
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:55,240
No, no, no! Bro, bro, bro!

530
00:36:55,264 --> 00:36:56,763
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

531
00:36:56,787 --> 00:36:58,939
You want money?
You want crypto? NFTs?

532
00:36:58,963 --> 00:37:00,463
I got fucking NFTs.

533
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:02,247
What are you fucking... What?

534
00:37:02,271 --> 00:37:04,447
No! Dude,
what the fuck is this, man?

535
00:37:07,668 --> 00:37:08,843
Don't move.

536
00:37:10,453 --> 00:37:12,063
I fucking can't move!

537
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:15,173
<i>You're fucking crazy, man.</i>

538
00:37:15,197 --> 00:37:17,025
What the fuck, bro?

539
00:37:31,735 --> 00:37:33,974
What the fuck!
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

540
00:37:33,998 --> 00:37:37,306
Fucking stop the fucking car!
No! No!

541
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,890
Who do I have the pleasure
of speaking with?

542
00:37:58,762 --> 00:38:00,677
Fuck you. That's who.

543
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:02,351
You burned down
my million-dollar

544
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:03,375
fucking call center.

545
00:38:04,377 --> 00:38:05,987
Now I'm going to burn you down.

546
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,748
You haven't told me your name.

547
00:38:08,772 --> 00:38:10,402
I told you my name.

548
00:38:10,426 --> 00:38:11,621
It's fuck you. Mr. Fuck You.

549
00:38:11,645 --> 00:38:12,883
You better fucking remember it.

550
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:14,319
<i>Because you don't burn me down.</i>

551
00:38:14,343 --> 00:38:15,973
<i>I burn you down.
You understand me?</i>

552
00:38:15,997 --> 00:38:18,434
You are fucking with forces
that you cannot comprehend.

553
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:20,523
You sound young.

554
00:38:21,655 --> 00:38:23,095
I bet you don't
have estate planning.

555
00:38:23,657 --> 00:38:26,050
I'm fucking 28 years old.
Why would I need that?

556
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:28,401
I'm about to show you.

557
00:38:46,897 --> 00:38:48,353
<i>Breaking news in Springfield,</i>

558
00:38:48,377 --> 00:38:50,007
<i>where three bodies
have been discovered</i>

559
00:38:50,031 --> 00:38:52,357
<i>following an arson fire
at a small farm.</i>

560
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:54,228
<i>There was an office building
explosion...</i>

561
00:38:54,252 --> 00:38:57,343
- And you say one guy did this?
- Yup.

562
00:38:58,953 --> 00:39:01,869
Killed seven armed men
without firing a shot.

563
00:39:02,696 --> 00:39:05,133
Yup. And he said
he was going to kill me.

564
00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:07,309
And this is your

565
00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:12,096
data mining consumer service
business, right?

566
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:14,664
Yes, something like that.

567
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,077
Pulling in 9 million a month
in one office.

568
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:18,276
I've got, like, 20.

569
00:39:19,713 --> 00:39:20,757
Yeah.

570
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,892
And the only thing
you know about him

571
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:27,285
is he says he's a beekeeper.

572
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,288
Yeah, it's like
his whole brand or whatever.

573
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,598
Jesus.

574
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:37,576
What?

575
00:39:40,037 --> 00:39:46,348
For someone who has elevated
fucking up into an art form,

576
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:49,786
this might well
be your <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

577
00:39:50,874 --> 00:39:52,528
How did I fuck up?

578
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:56,010
I don't know.
You've done something.

579
00:39:57,098 --> 00:39:58,684
You've disturbed a Beekeeper.

580
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,207
Oh.

581
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,166
Oh, okay.
So fucking what?

582
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,037
Why'd I care if the guy
keeps bees?

583
00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:06,300
If a Beekeeper
says you're gonna die,

584
00:40:06,324 --> 00:40:07,500
you're gonna die.

585
00:40:08,326 --> 00:40:11,068
There's nothing I can do
or anybody else to stop it.

586
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:16,223
So, like, what do you
even do here, then?

587
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,858
What good are you?

588
00:40:18,336 --> 00:40:19,599
Yeah.

589
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:26,301
I did 35 years of loyal
government service,

590
00:40:27,128 --> 00:40:29,846
culminating as director
of the world's

591
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,717
premier intelligence agency.

592
00:40:31,741 --> 00:40:33,284
I could have done anything,

593
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:35,702
but I chose this job
as a favor to your mother.

594
00:40:37,443 --> 00:40:39,880
I keep
Danforth Enterprises safe.

595
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:44,513
Keep her reputation safe,
her name safe.

596
00:40:44,537 --> 00:40:46,602
It's my fucking name too,
all right?

597
00:40:46,626 --> 00:40:48,430
Oh, sit down.

598
00:40:48,454 --> 00:40:50,170
I put up with you.

599
00:40:50,194 --> 00:40:51,955
I've put up with your tantrums,

600
00:40:51,979 --> 00:40:55,069
kept you out of the tabloids,
kept you out of jail.

601
00:40:55,548 --> 00:40:59,508
The endless stream
of sex workers.

602
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,948
You're a drowning man.
Do you know that?

603
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:07,057
Mm.

604
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:08,015
You're scared.

605
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,562
Dead right I'm scared.

606
00:41:11,389 --> 00:41:13,566
Terrified. So should you be.

607
00:41:14,392 --> 00:41:17,483
Wallace, just tell me
what the fuck this guy is.

608
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:24,857
He's probably
the last pair of eyes

609
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:26,317
that you're going to sneer at.

610
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:33,910
Okay, listen.

611
00:41:33,934 --> 00:41:35,433
Remember our favorite
burning building?

612
00:41:35,457 --> 00:41:37,174
United Data Group.

613
00:41:37,198 --> 00:41:38,523
The guys who work there
are hackers,

614
00:41:38,547 --> 00:41:40,786
con men, fraudsters,
et cetera, et cetera.

615
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,899
Guy who ran it. Garnett.

616
00:41:43,421 --> 00:41:46,052
He's in the book.
He's a known mob associate.

617
00:41:46,076 --> 00:41:48,141
He's missing, but I've got
PD chasing him down.

618
00:41:48,165 --> 00:41:50,753
Okay, so I had some analysts
run some shit,

619
00:41:50,777 --> 00:41:53,320
and I think I'm starting to
get the shape of the animal.

620
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,671
Dude, I think United Data Group

621
00:41:55,695 --> 00:41:57,368
is one of several call centers.

622
00:41:57,392 --> 00:41:59,239
So there's got to be
like a central office

623
00:41:59,263 --> 00:42:00,502
that's controlling all of them,

624
00:42:00,526 --> 00:42:01,766
and that's what we got to find.

625
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:03,635
Wiley, this could be like

626
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:05,618
a billion-dollar-a-year
operation.

627
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:07,726
- Hello?
- Hey!

628
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,554
Did you hear a single word
I just said?

629
00:42:09,578 --> 00:42:10,579
Yeah.

630
00:42:13,103 --> 00:42:14,385
And?

631
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:15,908
I was just thinking
you come in here,

632
00:42:15,932 --> 00:42:17,257
hungover on your day off,

633
00:42:17,281 --> 00:42:18,737
and gain more yardage
on this thing

634
00:42:18,761 --> 00:42:20,415
than the whole squad has
in two years.

635
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:24,245
Yeah, well,
they fucked with my family.

636
00:42:26,073 --> 00:42:27,311
What'd you get on Clay?

637
00:42:27,335 --> 00:42:28,704
- Your beekeeper?
- Yeah.

638
00:42:28,728 --> 00:42:29,903
He's a ghost.

639
00:42:30,991 --> 00:42:32,272
What?

640
00:42:32,296 --> 00:42:34,013
Yeah, all I have
is a birth certificate

641
00:42:34,037 --> 00:42:35,038
and a social.

642
00:42:35,735 --> 00:42:37,147
The guy's never even.

643
00:42:37,171 --> 00:42:38,235
had a bank account,

644
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:40,566
credit card, flown on a plane.

645
00:42:41,088 --> 00:42:42,718
I ran his prints through
every database

646
00:42:42,742 --> 00:42:44,352
I can think of, no hits.

647
00:42:45,658 --> 00:42:46,896
That's bullshit.

648
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,360
This dude is former military
all day.

649
00:42:48,835 --> 00:42:50,421
No hits. I'm telling you.

650
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:51,596
Either he's never been printed,

651
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,318
or Adam Clay doesn't exist.

652
00:42:55,624 --> 00:42:57,297
Which is terrifying to me

653
00:42:57,321 --> 00:42:59,212
because he's probably
in a classified program.

654
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:03,153
Special Agent Wiley.

655
00:43:05,112 --> 00:43:06,393
Okay.

656
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,917
- Let's go.
- What?

657
00:43:07,941 --> 00:43:10,223
- They found the guy, Garnett.
- What?

658
00:43:10,247 --> 00:43:12,293
- They found him. Let's go.
- Oh, shit.

659
00:43:15,035 --> 00:43:16,621
Jessica.

660
00:43:16,645 --> 00:43:18,285
<i>I think you know
why I'm calling.</i>

661
00:43:18,952 --> 00:43:21,302
You know,
I'd do anything for you.

662
00:43:22,259 --> 00:43:25,001
Anything for you.

663
00:43:25,915 --> 00:43:27,240
Derek's scared shitless.

664
00:43:27,264 --> 00:43:28,962
I've never seen him this scared.

665
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:31,442
Well, he's made his bed.

666
00:43:32,748 --> 00:43:34,596
I'll give you a board seat
on the holding company.

667
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,925
That's another million a year.

668
00:43:36,404 --> 00:43:38,624
<i>Plus you promised
you'd take care of him.</i>

669
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,889
Look, I don't need that.
I have enough.

670
00:43:43,629 --> 00:43:44,978
So you got this?

671
00:43:47,415 --> 00:43:49,243
Yeah. You have my word.

672
00:43:49,722 --> 00:43:51,071
<i>Wallace...</i>

673
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:54,640
I still think of you...

674
00:43:55,945 --> 00:43:58,184
<i>sometimes.</i>

675
00:43:58,208 --> 00:43:59,208
Sometimes.

676
00:44:15,182 --> 00:44:16,768
Why are you calling me

677
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:18,030
on the "never call
this line" line?

678
00:44:18,054 --> 00:44:19,902
This is priority one, Janet.

679
00:44:19,926 --> 00:44:21,773
Well, if it was priority one,
I would know about it.

680
00:44:21,797 --> 00:44:23,601
Look, I'm heading downtown
to a POTUS brief.

681
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:24,670
<i>Just hear me out.</i>

682
00:44:25,279 --> 00:44:26,735
Now, you know who I work for,
don't you?

683
00:44:26,759 --> 00:44:28,780
<i>Oh, yeah.
God help you, Wallace.</i>

684
00:44:28,804 --> 00:44:29,805
Exactly.

685
00:44:30,371 --> 00:44:32,044
Well, Director Harward,

686
00:44:32,068 --> 00:44:33,698
my young friend,
seems to have caught

687
00:44:33,722 --> 00:44:35,855
the unwanted attentions of...

688
00:44:36,899 --> 00:44:38,485
I don't know
how else to say this.

689
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,685
Of a Beekeeper.

690
00:44:41,425 --> 00:44:44,187
Wait, a Beekeeper Beekeeper?

691
00:44:44,211 --> 00:44:45,560
As in.

692
00:44:46,082 --> 00:44:48,495
<i>- Well, that's not good.</i>
- No, it's not.

693
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,348
- What's the body count?
<i>- Seven today.</i>

694
00:44:53,133 --> 00:44:55,024
You busy making
funeral arrangements?

695
00:44:55,048 --> 00:44:57,398
I need help, Janet. Not jokes.

696
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,841
Is that Garnett?

697
00:45:06,363 --> 00:45:08,017
He was strapped
to an old pickup.

698
00:45:09,062 --> 00:45:10,062
Check this out.

699
00:45:27,384 --> 00:45:29,909
Does this mean you've
taken pity on an old man?

700
00:45:30,692 --> 00:45:34,391
So your problem?
He's retired from the program.

701
00:45:35,044 --> 00:45:36,263
No longer active.

702
00:45:38,744 --> 00:45:40,746
Well, that changes everything.

703
00:45:41,616 --> 00:45:43,725
The current active Beekeeper
is aware of the issue

704
00:45:43,749 --> 00:45:45,422
and is going
to be taking things from here.

705
00:45:45,446 --> 00:45:47,076
You can rest easy, old friend.

706
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,362
<i>Oh, no. Janet.</i>

707
00:45:48,928 --> 00:45:51,384
The current active Beekeeper
is a fucking lunatic

708
00:45:51,408 --> 00:45:53,430
<i>who should have been removed
months ago.</i>

709
00:45:53,454 --> 00:45:54,760
God help us now.

710
00:46:35,278 --> 00:46:36,453
Get out of here!

711
00:46:40,806 --> 00:46:42,285
Shit!

712
00:46:44,244 --> 00:46:46,333
- Excuse me.
- You're cool.

713
00:47:06,744 --> 00:47:08,853
You've been a busy bee.

714
00:47:08,877 --> 00:47:10,724
You're supposed to be retired.

715
00:47:10,748 --> 00:47:12,620
I'm assuming
you're my replacement.

716
00:47:44,565 --> 00:47:46,523
Fuck you!

717
00:48:40,099 --> 00:48:41,404
I need your keys.

718
00:48:57,246 --> 00:48:58,682
There's an issue.

719
00:48:59,422 --> 00:49:00,946
The problem has not been solved.

720
00:49:02,469 --> 00:49:03,470
Well...

721
00:49:05,211 --> 00:49:07,039
That is a surprise.

722
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:09,800
The Beekeepers
have studied the situation

723
00:49:09,824 --> 00:49:11,957
and have decided
to remain neutral.

724
00:49:12,479 --> 00:49:14,239
How can they do that?

725
00:49:14,263 --> 00:49:16,265
He was their man,
for fuck's sake!

726
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,224
<i>I'm sorry, Wallace.</i>

727
00:49:19,225 --> 00:49:20,487
You're on your own.

728
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,381
I thought you could
fucking handle this.

729
00:49:25,405 --> 00:49:26,948
I can handle this!

730
00:49:40,376 --> 00:49:41,508
Thank you.

731
00:49:42,509 --> 00:49:44,119
What you got for us,
Detective?

732
00:49:44,728 --> 00:49:46,184
That's her vehicle,

733
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:48,534
registered
to a Anisette Landress.

734
00:49:48,558 --> 00:49:51,798
The ATF are en route inbound
to take care of it.

735
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,520
We're way cooler than ATF.

736
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,652
I'll show you why I called them.

737
00:50:02,616 --> 00:50:03,941
That's a Minigun.

738
00:50:03,965 --> 00:50:05,662
They use those
on military vehicles.

739
00:50:06,098 --> 00:50:08,665
Did you know that puppy shoots
6,000 rounds a minute?

740
00:50:09,231 --> 00:50:10,643
I know.

741
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:12,365
Did you know
that's 100 rounds a second?

742
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,019
Yep, I know.

743
00:50:15,281 --> 00:50:16,998
Did you know
that you know a lot?

744
00:50:17,022 --> 00:50:18,477
Yes, I do.

745
00:50:18,501 --> 00:50:19,652
It's because I minored in math.

746
00:50:19,676 --> 00:50:21,176
I'm a pretty smart guy actually.

747
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,308
Okay, then, do you know
who Anisette Landress is?

748
00:50:23,332 --> 00:50:25,223
- Yes, I do.
- Go ahead and tell me.

749
00:50:25,247 --> 00:50:27,051
Someone who doesn't exist

750
00:50:27,075 --> 00:50:29,358
in any commercial
or government database.

751
00:50:29,382 --> 00:50:30,707
Someone who's a ghost.

752
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:33,038
Like our good friend Adam Clay.

753
00:50:35,127 --> 00:50:37,520
<i>"Beekeeping for Beekeepers."</i>

754
00:50:38,913 --> 00:50:40,369
Here's another reason

755
00:50:40,393 --> 00:50:41,674
that Anisette Landress

756
00:50:41,698 --> 00:50:43,178
is like our good friend
Adam Clay.

757
00:50:45,615 --> 00:50:47,052
Do you know what's that way?

758
00:50:48,096 --> 00:50:50,683
Springfield...

759
00:50:50,707 --> 00:50:52,579
...where the call center
was torched.

760
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,625
And that way
where Adam Clay's headed?

761
00:50:57,627 --> 00:50:58,715
Boston.

762
00:50:59,716 --> 00:51:00,848
Let's go.

763
00:51:02,763 --> 00:51:03,894
Thank you.

764
00:51:19,127 --> 00:51:20,322
How are you, my friend?

765
00:51:20,346 --> 00:51:22,237
- Good to see you, Sir.
- Good to see you.

766
00:51:22,261 --> 00:51:24,500
Yeah, come on,

767
00:51:24,524 --> 00:51:25,979
leave them alone.
Leave them alone.

768
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:27,720
Don't play with those things.
They go off.

769
00:51:27,744 --> 00:51:29,355
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

770
00:51:32,271 --> 00:51:34,838
When I was sworn in as director,

771
00:51:35,883 --> 00:51:39,254
I was read into programs
I never imagined existed.

772
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:42,629
Well...

773
00:51:44,196 --> 00:51:48,852
there are programs
even I wasn't privy to.

774
00:51:50,463 --> 00:51:52,029
Like the Beekeepers.

775
00:51:53,901 --> 00:51:57,010
The honeybee has always

776
00:51:57,034 --> 00:51:59,100
had a special relationship
with humanity.

777
00:51:59,124 --> 00:52:00,647
A sacred relationship.

778
00:52:01,561 --> 00:52:04,235
Why? No bees, no agriculture.

779
00:52:04,259 --> 00:52:06,435
No agriculture, no civilization.

780
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,720
Our nation is not
unlike a beehive,

781
00:52:10,744 --> 00:52:13,897
with its complex systems
of workers,

782
00:52:13,921 --> 00:52:15,899
caretakers, even royalty.

783
00:52:15,923 --> 00:52:20,033
If any of the beehive's
complex mechanisms

784
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,189
are compromised,

785
00:52:21,929 --> 00:52:24,149
the hive collapses.

786
00:52:25,498 --> 00:52:27,171
Someone a long time ago decided

787
00:52:27,195 --> 00:52:29,391
that a mechanism was needed

788
00:52:29,415 --> 00:52:30,870
to keep our nation safe.

789
00:52:30,894 --> 00:52:33,438
A mechanism
outside the chain of command,

790
00:52:33,462 --> 00:52:36,073
outside the system.

791
00:52:37,031 --> 00:52:41,949
Its one mission,
to keep the system safe.

792
00:52:42,602 --> 00:52:45,668
Beekeepers are given
all resources,

793
00:52:45,692 --> 00:52:49,889
empowered to act
on their own judgment.

794
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:52,370
For decades,
they have quietly worked

795
00:52:52,394 --> 00:52:54,657
to keep the hive safe.

796
00:52:55,702 --> 00:52:58,052
That is, until now.

797
00:52:59,401 --> 00:53:02,250
It appears
that a retired Beekeeper

798
00:53:02,274 --> 00:53:03,642
has gone off program

799
00:53:03,666 --> 00:53:06,645
and is acting
in what he mistakenly believes

800
00:53:06,669 --> 00:53:09,063
is the hive's best interest.

801
00:53:10,238 --> 00:53:11,520
Can't somebody just
pick up the phone

802
00:53:11,544 --> 00:53:13,652
and tell this yahoo
to stand-the-fuck down?

803
00:53:13,676 --> 00:53:15,872
That's the one thing
Beekeepers don't do.

804
00:53:15,896 --> 00:53:17,289
Stand down.

805
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,832
Not unlike bees themselves,

806
00:53:19,856 --> 00:53:23,445
Beekeepers keep working
until they die.

807
00:53:23,469 --> 00:53:25,229
So he's basically one of us.

808
00:53:25,253 --> 00:53:28,319
No. He's not like you.

809
00:53:28,343 --> 00:53:30,040
You're tier one operators,

810
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,218
former SEAL Team Six,
Delta Group.

811
00:53:35,002 --> 00:53:38,373
You are, in other words, pussies.

812
00:53:38,397 --> 00:53:40,462
If you were in the same room,

813
00:53:40,486 --> 00:53:41,617
he would kill you.

814
00:53:42,488 --> 00:53:46,598
With enough of you,
then maybe you just might

815
00:53:46,622 --> 00:53:49,079
in fact be able to kill him

816
00:53:49,103 --> 00:53:51,255
before he accomplishes his goal.

817
00:53:51,279 --> 00:53:52,628
What would that be?

818
00:53:54,108 --> 00:53:57,198
To kill his way
to the top of the hive.

819
00:54:00,245 --> 00:54:02,812
Mr. Pettis, you should
get your people moving.

820
00:54:11,299 --> 00:54:13,451
Dude, bees are interesting
little shits.

821
00:54:13,475 --> 00:54:14,844
Did you know that?

822
00:54:14,868 --> 00:54:16,933
I know they pollinate
a bunch of shit

823
00:54:16,957 --> 00:54:18,326
and we'd be fucked without them.

824
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:19,350
Listen.

825
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,503
"Some bees are queen slayers,"

826
00:54:21,527 --> 00:54:23,069
"which will rise up
and kill their queen"

827
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,549
"if she fails to produce"

828
00:54:24,573 --> 00:54:26,227
"the right kind
of male offspring."

829
00:54:27,315 --> 00:54:28,684
Fascinating.

830
00:54:29,926 --> 00:54:31,904
- No.
- Hm. Nope.

831
00:54:31,928 --> 00:54:33,210
- No.
- No!

832
00:54:33,234 --> 00:54:34,634
- It's your turn. You can't...
- No!

833
00:54:41,503 --> 00:54:43,026
Special Agent Parker.

834
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,029
Yeah.

835
00:54:46,813 --> 00:54:48,007
Okay.

836
00:54:48,031 --> 00:54:49,032
Thank you.

837
00:54:52,688 --> 00:54:53,733
What?

838
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,650
The deputy director is flying
up from DC to see us.

839
00:55:00,957 --> 00:55:03,849
Oh, fuck. This is your fault.

840
00:56:35,835 --> 00:56:37,769
Here's another
interesting factoid.

841
00:56:37,793 --> 00:56:39,118
Thank fuck.

842
00:56:39,142 --> 00:56:41,164
You know,
I was getting sick of enjoying

843
00:56:41,188 --> 00:56:42,363
my peaceful thoughts.

844
00:56:45,584 --> 00:56:46,952
Sir.

845
00:56:46,976 --> 00:56:48,606
Sir,
this is Special Agent Parker,

846
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:49,868
Special Agent Wiley.

847
00:56:49,892 --> 00:56:51,392
They'll be briefing you.

848
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:52,828
This is Deputy Director Prigg

849
00:56:52,852 --> 00:56:55,265
and Amanda Munoz,
special counsel.

850
00:56:55,289 --> 00:56:56,725
Mr. Deputy Director,

851
00:56:57,334 --> 00:56:58,834
my colleague and I believe

852
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:00,879
that three major crime scenes
in our area

853
00:57:00,903 --> 00:57:02,794
are connected
to a single subject.

854
00:57:02,818 --> 00:57:03,882
Adam Clay.

855
00:57:03,906 --> 00:57:05,362
He killed six people today.

856
00:57:05,386 --> 00:57:08,060
Based on the extensive
use of tradecraft

857
00:57:08,084 --> 00:57:09,695
and the nature of his alias,

858
00:57:10,217 --> 00:57:11,673
we believe
that Mr. Clay is connected

859
00:57:11,697 --> 00:57:14,090
to a classified program
named Beekeeper.

860
00:57:14,743 --> 00:57:16,852
A program that none
of our partner agencies

861
00:57:16,876 --> 00:57:18,051
seem willing to acknowledge.

862
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:20,490
Let's stick to what we know,
Special Agent Parker.

863
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:22,577
Yes, Sir.

864
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:25,600
In any event, this individual
is highly capable

865
00:57:25,624 --> 00:57:27,103
and extremely motivated,

866
00:57:27,495 --> 00:57:29,342
and we believe that he's
on his way to Boston,

867
00:57:29,366 --> 00:57:30,735
if not already here.

868
00:57:30,759 --> 00:57:33,825
And we believe
that this is his next target,

869
00:57:33,849 --> 00:57:35,348
Nine Star United,

870
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:37,089
which appears to be the entity

871
00:57:37,113 --> 00:57:38,656
operating the regional
call centers,

872
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,508
like the one
that Mr. Clay burned down.

873
00:57:41,074 --> 00:57:43,468
Why is Adam Clay
on this rampage?

874
00:57:44,817 --> 00:57:48,777
He's, um,
protecting the hive, Sir.

875
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:50,692
It's what Beekeepers do.

876
00:57:51,214 --> 00:57:52,614
I have enough
to brief the director.

877
00:57:53,652 --> 00:57:55,499
- What's your ask?
- My ask?

878
00:57:55,523 --> 00:57:58,700
Uh, well, a SWAT team,
for starters.

879
00:57:59,222 --> 00:58:01,834
Surveillance support,
additional agents, analysts.

880
00:58:02,661 --> 00:58:04,053
That shouldn't be a problem.

881
00:58:04,445 --> 00:58:05,446
Thank you.

882
00:58:13,149 --> 00:58:15,325
- Did that just happen?
- Yeah.

883
00:58:22,245 --> 00:58:23,440
All right.
Everybody, listen up.

884
00:58:23,464 --> 00:58:24,702
It's roll call time.

885
00:58:24,726 --> 00:58:27,052
I'm getting ready
for my dick to get hard

886
00:58:27,076 --> 00:58:29,751
with some wonderful,
beautiful numbers.

887
00:58:29,775 --> 00:58:31,666
Let's start with Phoenix.
Where we at?

888
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:33,755
Phoenix is up 201K.

889
00:58:33,779 --> 00:58:36,148
200K, I'm gonna
suck your dick. I love you.

890
00:58:36,172 --> 00:58:38,020
New Orleans, show me,

891
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:39,587
tell me. Where we at?

892
00:58:39,611 --> 00:58:40,979
It's down 93K, boss.

893
00:58:41,003 --> 00:58:42,981
Down? You're a fucking loser.

894
00:58:43,005 --> 00:58:44,766
You give me a fucking headache.

895
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:45,897
You give me fucking cancer.

896
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:47,986
New York, make me happy.
I beg you.

897
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:51,250
New York City's up 64 ASCOT.

898
00:58:51,274 --> 00:58:53,862
Yeah! I love you, New York!

899
00:59:00,893 --> 00:59:02,566
Gather around!

900
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:04,437
I want all weapons
front on entry.

901
00:59:04,461 --> 00:59:06,135
- Everybody give me an oos!
- Oos!

902
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:07,223
Let's go!

903
00:59:12,295 --> 00:59:15,231
Power down, my federal friend.
Power down.

904
00:59:15,255 --> 00:59:17,494
Private security here
on the orders of the Governor.

905
00:59:17,518 --> 00:59:19,496
State Department certified
to carry weapons

906
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,608
in all 50 states.

907
00:59:22,218 --> 00:59:23,674
Feel free to call
the highlighted numbers

908
00:59:23,698 --> 00:59:24,830
to verify.

909
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,615
You're not welcome here.
Get the fuck out.

910
00:59:28,747 --> 00:59:30,400
All right, boys, let's go!

911
00:59:32,707 --> 00:59:34,579
Set up a perimeter outside.

912
00:59:35,144 --> 00:59:37,775
Your goals, they mean bonuses.

913
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:39,975
Money, money, money,
we fucking love it.

914
00:59:41,281 --> 00:59:43,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the fuck?

915
00:59:43,544 --> 00:59:45,609
Who the fuck are you?
You can't be in here.

916
00:59:45,633 --> 00:59:47,437
We're the guys
keeping you alive.

917
00:59:47,461 --> 00:59:48,830
Shut it down now.

918
00:59:48,854 --> 00:59:50,440
Everybody, listen up.

919
00:59:50,464 --> 00:59:51,920
Anyone who's
not carrying a weapon,

920
00:59:51,944 --> 00:59:53,443
get the fuck out!

921
00:59:53,467 --> 00:59:54,923
Shouldn't you be killing
bin Laden or something?

922
00:59:54,947 --> 00:59:58,622
Listen to me, my friend.
This place prints money.

923
00:59:58,646 --> 01:00:00,406
No one's shutting down.

924
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,869
Anybody so much as puts
a phone down, they're fired!

925
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:06,108
I'm sorry to break it to you,

926
01:00:06,132 --> 01:00:07,675
but bin Laden's been dead
for a while.

927
01:00:07,699 --> 01:00:09,981
So I'm going to say this
one last time.

928
01:00:10,005 --> 01:00:11,267
Shut it down.

929
01:00:12,225 --> 01:00:13,443
The fuck I am.

930
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:16,161
Call your fucking boss.

931
01:00:16,185 --> 01:00:17,447
You want me to call my boss?

932
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:19,362
I'll do that.

933
01:00:20,059 --> 01:00:24,498
And you'll be so fucked,
it's gonna be beautiful.

934
01:00:26,326 --> 01:00:27,719
Don't be shy. Come on.

935
01:00:28,981 --> 01:00:30,741
What about the parking garage?

936
01:00:30,765 --> 01:00:32,656
Closed and locked. Steel gate.

937
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,247
I want a body on comms
watching it.

938
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,747
- Delivery dock?
- Same deal.

939
01:00:36,771 --> 01:00:38,706
- Station an agent there too.
- Yes, Sir.

940
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:40,838
Sure there's no back entrances
into this place?

941
01:00:40,862 --> 01:00:42,318
Hey,
there're no other entrances.

942
01:00:42,342 --> 01:00:44,625
Federal law enforcement
operation in progress.

943
01:00:44,649 --> 01:00:45,887
Move along at a minimum retreat

944
01:00:45,911 --> 01:00:47,323
to a safe distance.
Thank you.

945
01:00:47,347 --> 01:00:48,759
Someone scout
the service tunnel.

946
01:00:48,783 --> 01:00:51,675
The other option,
instead of going in

947
01:00:51,699 --> 01:00:53,024
is to smoke them out.

948
01:00:53,048 --> 01:00:54,330
Excuse me?

949
01:00:54,354 --> 01:00:56,225
I figured I'd give
the firefighters a break.

950
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,161
I've put them through
enough already.

951
01:00:59,185 --> 01:01:00,728
What'd you say your name was?

952
01:01:00,752 --> 01:01:02,362
Currently I go by Adam Clay.

953
01:01:03,015 --> 01:01:04,949
Trust me,
if there was a back entrance,

954
01:01:04,973 --> 01:01:06,211
I would've used it.

955
01:01:06,235 --> 01:01:07,691
I don't want to injure anyone

956
01:01:07,715 --> 01:01:08,995
who's innocent and non-involved.

957
01:01:10,022 --> 01:01:11,501
But it is what it is.

958
01:01:12,067 --> 01:01:13,610
Somebody detain this guy!

959
01:01:39,965 --> 01:01:41,444
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

960
01:01:51,846 --> 01:01:53,650
Oh, wow, if it isn't the fucking

961
01:01:53,674 --> 01:01:55,043
golden goose himself.

962
01:01:55,067 --> 01:01:56,740
Sir, I got Captain Caveman here

963
01:01:56,764 --> 01:01:58,916
telling me
to send everyone home.

964
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,091
If we do that,

965
01:02:00,115 --> 01:02:01,702
we're walking away
from a lot of money.

966
01:02:01,726 --> 01:02:03,292
Mm. Put him on.

967
01:02:04,467 --> 01:02:05,512
It's for you.

968
01:02:07,253 --> 01:02:09,013
Why are you fucking
with my business?

969
01:02:09,037 --> 01:02:10,798
Because Mr. Westwyld hired me

970
01:02:10,822 --> 01:02:12,867
to kick some
fucking Beekeeper's ass.

971
01:02:13,738 --> 01:02:15,759
Mr. Westwyld works for me,

972
01:02:15,783 --> 01:02:17,959
which means
that you work for me.

973
01:02:18,699 --> 01:02:19,894
Now, listen, that place

974
01:02:19,918 --> 01:02:21,789
is the crown jewel
of my kingdom.

975
01:02:22,485 --> 01:02:23,898
I'm not gonna
let some crash test dummy

976
01:02:23,922 --> 01:02:25,290
with a fucking gun fuck it up.

977
01:02:25,314 --> 01:02:27,118
Is that clear, Mr. Pettis?

978
01:02:27,142 --> 01:02:28,293
Didn't this character
already burn

979
01:02:28,317 --> 01:02:29,773
one of your centers
to the ground?

980
01:02:29,797 --> 01:02:31,644
Well, you know,
they didn't have you,

981
01:02:31,668 --> 01:02:32,907
and that's why.

982
01:02:32,931 --> 01:02:35,083
So maybe you just
do your fucking job

983
01:02:35,107 --> 01:02:37,215
and don't tell me
how to do mine, please.

984
01:02:37,239 --> 01:02:39,067
<i>- We got it?</i>
- Copy that.

985
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,700
Fall out.
Set up a perimeter outside.

986
01:02:43,724 --> 01:02:45,136
Let's go. Move!

987
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,964
Round of applause.

988
01:02:46,988 --> 01:02:48,879
Let's say goodbye
to our good friends.

989
01:02:48,903 --> 01:02:52,317
Bye-bye, Admiral.
Go join fucking Space Force.

990
01:02:52,341 --> 01:02:55,799
You are beautiful.
Now get the fuck out!

991
01:02:55,823 --> 01:02:57,235
Keep walking.

992
01:02:57,259 --> 01:02:58,783
Bye-bye, dickhead.

993
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:02,458
What a bunch of jackoffs.

994
01:03:02,482 --> 01:03:04,179
Yeah, we love you!

995
01:03:14,973 --> 01:03:16,559
One time amnesty.

996
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:18,169
Whoever doesn't want to die
this evening,

997
01:03:18,193 --> 01:03:21,631
can in an orderly fashion
leave now.

998
01:03:22,154 --> 01:03:24,001
Uh, uh, uh. No fucking way.
It's not happening.

999
01:03:24,025 --> 01:03:25,786
Anybody moves, you're fired.

1000
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:28,179
- No bonus, vesting, two weeks.
- Come on, boys! Move, move!

1001
01:03:28,203 --> 01:03:29,291
Nada. Zero!

1002
01:03:30,205 --> 01:03:31,835
Are you fucking nuts?

1003
01:03:31,859 --> 01:03:33,532
Each one of these
pricks is worth

1004
01:03:33,556 --> 01:03:35,534
30 to 40 million a year
in profit.

1005
01:03:35,558 --> 01:03:38,189
So no one is shooting no guns.

1006
01:03:38,213 --> 01:03:40,670
Not a good day to drag
innocent people into this.

1007
01:03:40,694 --> 01:03:42,585
These assholes?
They're not innocent.

1008
01:03:42,609 --> 01:03:44,805
For either one of us
to close that distance,

1009
01:03:44,829 --> 01:03:46,502
some of them will get hurt.

1010
01:03:46,526 --> 01:03:48,354
Let's start with this prick
right here.

1011
01:04:03,325 --> 01:04:04,457
On me!

1012
01:04:13,553 --> 01:04:14,684
Take right!

1013
01:04:30,004 --> 01:04:31,397
Pettis, we got a man down.

1014
01:04:53,419 --> 01:04:54,899
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1015
01:04:57,292 --> 01:04:58,554
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1016
01:05:05,126 --> 01:05:07,041
You know who you're working for?

1017
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:09,237
None of my fucking business.

1018
01:05:09,261 --> 01:05:11,263
I'm just the guy they call
when there's a problem.

1019
01:05:15,397 --> 01:05:17,182
And you are our problem.

1020
01:05:17,704 --> 01:05:19,575
Goddamn right, I'm a problem.

1021
01:05:42,598 --> 01:05:44,383
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1022
01:05:46,515 --> 01:05:48,406
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1023
01:05:58,484 --> 01:05:59,876
Dan, what the hell happened?

1024
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:01,942
Any dead?

1025
01:06:01,966 --> 01:06:03,769
Not dead,
but we got our asses kicked.

1026
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,294
- Our guy. What do we know?
- He's in the building.

1027
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:07,710
I'm waiting more men to roll in.

1028
01:06:08,189 --> 01:06:09,558
I don't know what this guy is,

1029
01:06:09,582 --> 01:06:11,081
but nobody can do
what he's done.

1030
01:06:11,105 --> 01:06:12,933
He's just a Beekeeper.

1031
01:06:14,152 --> 01:06:15,414
Bad idea.

1032
01:06:17,024 --> 01:06:18,132
I'm not waiting.

1033
01:06:18,156 --> 01:06:19,437
- V, wait!
- Move!

1034
01:06:19,461 --> 01:06:20,636
Come on, Wiley, keep up.

1035
01:06:21,246 --> 01:06:22,334
Fuck.

1036
01:06:35,695 --> 01:06:37,001
We got him!

1037
01:06:48,229 --> 01:06:49,970
- You done?
- Reload.

1038
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:57,432
Everybody out!

1039
01:07:09,294 --> 01:07:10,338
You're done.

1040
01:07:27,442 --> 01:07:28,530
We should take the stairs.

1041
01:07:29,053 --> 01:07:30,054
Smart.

1042
01:07:30,837 --> 01:07:32,926
<i>Subject is in the hallway.</i>

1043
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,712
<i>Command, report back.
Anybody on comm?</i>

1044
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:49,832
Please, please don't kill me.

1045
01:07:49,856 --> 01:07:53,251
I'm just a middle manager.
I never hurt nobody.

1046
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:55,490
I'd respect you more
if you look people

1047
01:07:55,514 --> 01:07:57,516
in their eyes
when you steal from them.

1048
01:08:09,789 --> 01:08:11,549
Now, you're making
a lot of money here.

1049
01:08:12,444 --> 01:08:14,010
Tell me where it's all going.

1050
01:08:14,446 --> 01:08:15,447
I don't know, man.

1051
01:08:19,668 --> 01:08:21,298
I know you're the middle man.

1052
01:08:21,322 --> 01:08:25,196
- Who's above you?
- No. They'll kill me.

1053
01:08:29,156 --> 01:08:30,916
I'll torture you, then kill you.

1054
01:08:36,598 --> 01:08:37,967
Come on, guys. You got it.

1055
01:08:37,991 --> 01:08:40,230
Wiley,
get your ass up here!

1056
01:08:40,254 --> 01:08:43,146
Yeah, well, I'm not an Olympian.

1057
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:45,061
Make it stop.

1058
01:08:45,085 --> 01:08:46,478
You can make it stop.

1059
01:08:47,348 --> 01:08:49,587
You've stolen
hundreds of millions

1060
01:08:49,611 --> 01:08:50,893
from people who've done nothing

1061
01:08:50,917 --> 01:08:52,310
but work hard all their lives.

1062
01:08:57,141 --> 01:08:59,554
She was an educator, a mom.

1063
01:08:59,578 --> 01:09:01,841
Dedicated her whole life
to helping people.

1064
01:09:04,017 --> 01:09:05,584
Yesterday, she shot herself

1065
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,457
because you took two million
from a charity she ran.

1066
01:09:14,941 --> 01:09:17,204
She was the only person
who ever took care of me.

1067
01:09:21,208 --> 01:09:23,515
Who and where, Mr. Anzalone?

1068
01:09:24,255 --> 01:09:26,320
- Tell me who and where.
- I can't.

1069
01:09:26,344 --> 01:09:27,538
Look, these people,

1070
01:09:27,562 --> 01:09:29,105
they're untouchable.
I can't...

1071
01:09:29,129 --> 01:09:31,697
No, please! Please!
Stop! I will! I will!

1072
01:09:32,176 --> 01:09:34,134
Let me show you.
Let me show you.

1073
01:09:52,587 --> 01:09:54,198
I told you
they were untouchable.

1074
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,549
Nobody's untouchable.

1075
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,816
Sometimes when the hive's
out of balance...

1076
01:10:06,166 --> 01:10:07,602
you have to replace the queen.

1077
01:10:12,912 --> 01:10:14,348
Clay!

1078
01:10:17,656 --> 01:10:19,547
That man is directly responsible

1079
01:10:19,571 --> 01:10:20,746
for your mother's death.

1080
01:10:24,315 --> 01:10:25,446
I believe you.

1081
01:10:26,317 --> 01:10:28,449
But we have laws
for these things.

1082
01:10:31,452 --> 01:10:33,846
You have laws for these things
until they fail.

1083
01:10:35,935 --> 01:10:37,110
Then you have me.

1084
01:10:47,425 --> 01:10:48,774
Arrest him!

1085
01:10:49,122 --> 01:10:51,231
On your feet before I blow
your fucking head off.

1086
01:10:51,255 --> 01:10:53,276
I just been thrown through
a plate glass window.

1087
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,388
Shut your fucking mouth!

1088
01:11:07,662 --> 01:11:09,664
Whoa. I have four kids.

1089
01:11:11,318 --> 01:11:14,016
I know. Three boys and a girl.

1090
01:11:26,594 --> 01:11:28,833
Wiley? You okay?

1091
01:11:28,857 --> 01:11:30,705
- Yeah. He went that way.
- You okay?

1092
01:11:30,729 --> 01:11:32,097
- Have you been hit?
- My wife thinks

1093
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,403
I'm doing computer nerd shit.

1094
01:11:33,427 --> 01:11:34,839
Well, I won't tell her
if you don't.

1095
01:11:34,863 --> 01:11:36,232
- Have you been hit?
- No, I'm good, Mom.

1096
01:11:36,256 --> 01:11:37,494
Did you get him?

1097
01:11:37,518 --> 01:11:39,322
- Did you?
- No, he's tricky.

1098
01:11:39,346 --> 01:11:41,019
- Get up. You okay?
- Almost, but...

1099
01:11:41,043 --> 01:11:42,543
I guess that's just evidence.

1100
01:11:42,567 --> 01:11:45,110
- Can I borrow your gun?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1101
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,854
- On me. On me. On me. On me.
- Clear!

1102
01:11:54,405 --> 01:11:56,189
I want interviews
with all of them.

1103
01:12:02,674 --> 01:12:03,718
We're going to talk.

1104
01:12:04,632 --> 01:12:05,720
Get him out of here.

1105
01:12:23,259 --> 01:12:24,478
Wiley.

1106
01:12:32,094 --> 01:12:33,139
Holy shit.

1107
01:12:44,455 --> 01:12:45,823
Do you mind
if I ask you

1108
01:12:45,847 --> 01:12:47,066
a really boring question?

1109
01:12:47,632 --> 01:12:49,938
Do you actually prefer
the money or the power?

1110
01:12:50,678 --> 01:12:51,786
Mm.

1111
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:52,941
That's deep.

1112
01:12:53,551 --> 01:12:55,711
Oh, I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

1113
01:12:57,598 --> 01:12:59,533
Oh, God. Uh...

1114
01:12:59,557 --> 01:13:01,559
Would you excuse me
for a moment? Come upstairs.

1115
01:13:05,519 --> 01:13:08,280
<i>You said these guys
were the fucking best. Uh...</i>

1116
01:13:08,304 --> 01:13:09,349
Why are they all dead?

1117
01:13:10,524 --> 01:13:11,893
You kicked the beehive

1118
01:13:11,917 --> 01:13:14,093
and now we have
to reap the whirlwind.

1119
01:13:16,312 --> 01:13:18,465
- Unless...
- Unless.

1120
01:13:18,489 --> 01:13:20,273
Unless, unless,
unless fucking what?

1121
01:13:21,666 --> 01:13:23,644
Maybe now is the time
to call your mother.

1122
01:13:26,671 --> 01:13:28,083
I'm paying you
so much fucking money

1123
01:13:28,107 --> 01:13:29,547
and your advice
is to call my mother?

1124
01:13:30,544 --> 01:13:33,436
He can't make his move on us

1125
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:35,897
if we're in her proximity,
can he?

1126
01:13:36,463 --> 01:13:37,464
Her people.

1127
01:13:44,776 --> 01:13:45,864
You're a fuck.

1128
01:13:46,517 --> 01:13:48,277
- You're scared...
- I certainly am scared.

1129
01:13:48,301 --> 01:13:49,496
...and you want
to use my mother

1130
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,671
as a human shield.

1131
01:13:50,695 --> 01:13:52,784
Just call her.
Just call her. Come on.

1132
01:13:53,654 --> 01:13:55,327
It's not a game now.

1133
01:13:55,351 --> 01:13:56,440
Oh, it's all a game.

1134
01:13:56,962 --> 01:13:58,311
Come on.

1135
01:13:59,051 --> 01:14:00,768
Yes, Derek. What do you want?

1136
01:14:00,792 --> 01:14:02,770
<i>Hey, Mom. No, nothing.</i>

1137
01:14:02,794 --> 01:14:04,598
<i>I was just, you know,
thinking about you.</i>

1138
01:14:04,622 --> 01:14:07,233
<i>I miss you. I was hoping
to maybe see you this weekend.</i>

1139
01:14:07,929 --> 01:14:09,254
I'm at the beach house.

1140
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:10,718
You're welcome to join
if you behave.

1141
01:14:11,324 --> 01:14:13,345
<i>I would love to. And, hey,
I actually was going to,</i>

1142
01:14:13,369 --> 01:14:14,825
<i>you know,
get together with some of my</i>

1143
01:14:14,849 --> 01:14:16,131
<i>tech homies and stuff,
if that's, uh,</i>

1144
01:14:16,155 --> 01:14:17,567
<i>if that's cool with you.</i>

1145
01:14:17,591 --> 01:14:19,134
Fine. No drugs.

1146
01:14:19,158 --> 01:14:21,160
Give Kelly the details.
Love you. Have to go.

1147
01:14:22,509 --> 01:14:23,834
Derek's joining me this weekend.

1148
01:14:23,858 --> 01:14:25,096
Help me keep him sober.

1149
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,557
Yes, ma'am.
I love babysitting.

1150
01:14:27,122 --> 01:14:28,926
Madame President, Funmi Lawal.

1151
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:30,667
Hello. Good to meet you.

1152
01:14:30,691 --> 01:14:32,016
Sola Oyemade.

1153
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,496
Sola, thank you so much
for coming.

1154
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,845
Susan Aneno.

1155
01:14:34,869 --> 01:14:36,499
Thank you so much
for coming all this way.

1156
01:14:36,523 --> 01:14:37,655
Oli Ray-Imanuel.

1157
01:14:38,177 --> 01:14:40,377
- Oli, how good to meet you.
- Great to meet you, ma'am.

1158
01:14:47,012 --> 01:14:48,796
You don't have to do this,
you know?

1159
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:52,060
Why not let Clay do his thing?

1160
01:14:54,454 --> 01:14:56,456
Your mom is dead
because of these people.

1161
01:15:04,856 --> 01:15:06,205
Wherever it's headed...

1162
01:15:07,859 --> 01:15:08,947
I swore an oath.

1163
01:15:10,209 --> 01:15:12,428
I can't stand by
and watch it happen.

1164
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:20,915
Even if he's right?

1165
01:15:27,226 --> 01:15:28,314
Even if he's right.

1166
01:15:31,012 --> 01:15:33,687
<i>Apologies.
Damn plane was delayed.</i>

1167
01:15:33,711 --> 01:15:34,755
<i>What have you got?</i>

1168
01:15:35,277 --> 01:15:38,518
We think we have a sense
of Mr. Clay's true intentions.

1169
01:15:38,542 --> 01:15:40,935
He seems to be
following the money.

1170
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,242
<i>What money is that?</i>

1171
01:15:43,764 --> 01:15:46,917
Usually it's from people
with no heirs, no family.

1172
01:15:46,941 --> 01:15:49,572
Nine Star United uses
data mining software

1173
01:15:49,596 --> 01:15:52,686
to identify these people
and then target their assets.

1174
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:56,448
There's another
company involved, Sir,

1175
01:15:56,472 --> 01:15:58,973
a company who is a vendor
to the intelligence community

1176
01:15:58,997 --> 01:16:00,365
and to the Justice Department.

1177
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:02,498
In fact,
we use this company's software

1178
01:16:02,522 --> 01:16:04,108
in this very office

1179
01:16:04,132 --> 01:16:06,700
to identify financial fraud.

1180
01:16:08,528 --> 01:16:10,488
<i>Are you going to tell me
the name of this company?</i>

1181
01:16:16,101 --> 01:16:18,340
Danforth Enterprises.

1182
01:16:18,364 --> 01:16:21,691
With an annual revenue
of $10 billion,

1183
01:16:21,715 --> 01:16:25,739
founded and operated
by Jessica Danforth,

1184
01:16:25,763 --> 01:16:28,219
who recently stepped down
because she was sworn in

1185
01:16:28,243 --> 01:16:30,768
as President
of the United States.

1186
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:33,137
<i>She self-financed her campaign.</i>

1187
01:16:33,161 --> 01:16:35,860
Yeah.
None of that money was clean.

1188
01:16:36,251 --> 01:16:37,513
<i>Who else knows this?</i>

1189
01:16:38,993 --> 01:16:40,275
Us three.

1190
01:16:40,299 --> 01:16:42,799
I have a really bad memory, Sir.

1191
01:16:42,823 --> 01:16:45,802
<i>Let's, uh,
keep the circle small,</i>

1192
01:16:45,826 --> 01:16:48,065
<i>until I can brief the director
and the attorney general.</i>

1193
01:16:48,089 --> 01:16:50,067
<i>Not a word of this to anyone.
Understood?</i>

1194
01:16:50,091 --> 01:16:51,460
Yes, Sir.

1195
01:16:51,484 --> 01:16:53,027
<i>And, Mr. Clay,
I see his kill count</i>

1196
01:16:53,051 --> 01:16:54,594
<i>is steadily rising.</i>

1197
01:16:54,618 --> 01:16:55,899
In a beehive, there is something

1198
01:16:55,923 --> 01:16:57,403
called a "queen slayer."

1199
01:16:57,795 --> 01:17:00,885
It's a bee that will rise up
and kill the queen

1200
01:17:01,494 --> 01:17:04,081
if she produces
defective offspring.

1201
01:17:04,105 --> 01:17:06,518
<i>I thought we were sticking
to the known knowns.</i>

1202
01:17:06,542 --> 01:17:09,565
Right. Yes.
Not that Beekeepers exist.

1203
01:17:09,589 --> 01:17:12,568
But Mr. Clay
does keep honey bees.

1204
01:17:12,592 --> 01:17:14,657
He admires their willingness

1205
01:17:14,681 --> 01:17:17,336
to sacrifice themselves
for the greater good.

1206
01:17:18,946 --> 01:17:22,863
Our concern is that Clay
believes that Derek Danforth

1207
01:17:23,342 --> 01:17:25,649
is the defective offspring
of a queen,

1208
01:17:26,301 --> 01:17:29,280
thereby Clay will strike
at the heart of the problem

1209
01:17:29,304 --> 01:17:31,524
and become a queen slayer.

1210
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,747
<i>Adam Clay's next victim
is Derek Danforth's mother?</i>

1211
01:17:37,617 --> 01:17:39,750
President Danforth, Sir.

1212
01:17:40,141 --> 01:17:42,796
<i>You have a blank check.
Good luck.</i>

1213
01:17:44,711 --> 01:17:45,886
Thank you.

1214
01:18:02,033 --> 01:18:03,793
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa. This is a private event.

1215
01:18:03,817 --> 01:18:06,013
I'm gonna need you
to turn around, go away.

1216
01:18:06,037 --> 01:18:07,884
Federal Bureau of something
or another.

1217
01:18:07,908 --> 01:18:09,538
We're good.
We have invites right here.

1218
01:18:09,562 --> 01:18:11,235
All right. You'll need
to excuse my partner.

1219
01:18:11,259 --> 01:18:13,063
He's recently concussed
and hasn't slept in two days.

1220
01:18:13,087 --> 01:18:14,087
We're on the access list.

1221
01:18:14,959 --> 01:18:16,700
We're good, boss.

1222
01:18:44,815 --> 01:18:46,706
Get the Secret Service
out of the house.

1223
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:47,881
I don't want them here.

1224
01:18:47,905 --> 01:18:49,907
They're C team.
B team at best.

1225
01:18:50,516 --> 01:18:53,103
Uh, Mom's detail is not going
to like that.

1226
01:18:53,127 --> 01:18:55,845
Well, if Mom's detail
gets in the way

1227
01:18:55,869 --> 01:18:56,977
of what's coming for us,

1228
01:18:57,001 --> 01:18:58,567
they're dead men and so are we.

1229
01:19:00,221 --> 01:19:01,982
Tell them they can
stay in the kitchen.

1230
01:19:02,006 --> 01:19:02,940
Yes, Sir.

1231
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:09,772
He has a little talent,
doesn't he?

1232
01:19:09,796 --> 01:19:11,252
He's absolutely
fucking terrifying.

1233
01:19:11,276 --> 01:19:12,732
Yeah.

1234
01:19:12,756 --> 01:19:14,436
Good men,
but clearly not good enough.

1235
01:19:14,888 --> 01:19:16,779
- Hm.
- Fuck, bruh!

1236
01:19:16,803 --> 01:19:18,781
How'd you piss this oak off, huh?

1237
01:19:18,805 --> 01:19:20,174
I...

1238
01:19:20,198 --> 01:19:21,915
- You're looking at me?
- Mm-hmm.

1239
01:19:21,939 --> 01:19:23,592
How is any of this my fault?

1240
01:19:24,202 --> 01:19:26,136
Wasn't your supersecret CIA

1241
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,747
data mining software
supposed to,

1242
01:19:27,771 --> 01:19:29,009
I don't know, maybe filter out

1243
01:19:29,033 --> 01:19:30,750
un-fucking-stoppable
killing machines?

1244
01:19:30,774 --> 01:19:32,229
Don't you fuck with me,
young man!

1245
01:19:32,253 --> 01:19:34,014
Any other life,
you'd be in jail.

1246
01:19:34,038 --> 01:19:36,562
Hey, this is the fucking
Beekeeper!

1247
01:19:40,174 --> 01:19:42,152
Yeah, you know
I killed one once.

1248
01:19:42,176 --> 01:19:43,458
Oh, you see?

1249
01:19:43,482 --> 01:19:45,677
Yeah. Only 'cause I was lucky.

1250
01:19:45,701 --> 01:19:48,313
- And un-fucking-lucky.
- Oh, jeez.

1251
01:19:51,142 --> 01:19:53,250
Yeah, don't piss your pants, bruh.

1252
01:19:53,274 --> 01:19:54,667
My team will be out shortly.

1253
01:19:55,102 --> 01:19:56,427
If anyone can knock

1254
01:19:56,451 --> 01:19:58,255
this guy's dick in the dirt,
it's them.

1255
01:19:58,279 --> 01:20:00,804
Ain't that right, money man?

1256
01:20:02,893 --> 01:20:04,372
Yeah.

1257
01:20:19,997 --> 01:20:21,713
I'm supposed to be
at a kids' birthday party

1258
01:20:21,737 --> 01:20:22,738
with my wife.

1259
01:20:26,786 --> 01:20:28,633
You are at a kids'
birthday party.

1260
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:29,920
And I'm your work wife.

1261
01:20:45,065 --> 01:20:47,696
Madam President,
you look spectacular.

1262
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,219
When the fuck are you
going to tell me

1263
01:20:49,243 --> 01:20:50,679
what's going on, Wallace?

1264
01:20:54,335 --> 01:20:55,815
Good. Go through.

1265
01:20:56,903 --> 01:20:58,968
Tell that guy
to hurry up.

1266
01:20:58,992 --> 01:21:01,797
I want every manhole
on this street welded shut.

1267
01:21:10,743 --> 01:21:11,918
Six up.

1268
01:21:12,832 --> 01:21:13,877
Good to go.

1269
01:21:15,182 --> 01:21:16,488
Let's go. Let's go.

1270
01:21:28,587 --> 01:21:30,328
Come on. Move it up.

1271
01:21:47,214 --> 01:21:49,129
Put your head
on a swivel, gentlemen.

1272
01:22:05,537 --> 01:22:06,538
Go!

1273
01:22:34,174 --> 01:22:36,394
We got eyes
on the second floor.

1274
01:22:43,836 --> 01:22:45,794
All right, you're good.
Coming through.

1275
01:23:09,557 --> 01:23:11,013
Oh.

1276
01:23:11,037 --> 01:23:14,408
Hey. When, uh, did you get in?
What a surprise.

1277
01:23:16,042 --> 01:23:18,499
You didn't hear
the giant Marine helicopter

1278
01:23:18,523 --> 01:23:19,915
land on the front lawn?

1279
01:23:20,568 --> 01:23:22,503
Ah, I guess not. Hm.

1280
01:23:22,527 --> 01:23:24,722
Is this, uh, nicotine
or a carnival ride?

1281
01:23:24,746 --> 01:23:27,334
Uh, I wouldn't unless
you want to go

1282
01:23:27,358 --> 01:23:28,489
talk with the machine elves.

1283
01:23:32,928 --> 01:23:34,950
Hey, you look fucking great,
by the way.

1284
01:23:34,974 --> 01:23:37,803
I mean, power,
it just looks so good on you.

1285
01:23:38,282 --> 01:23:40,564
Doing blow
on your father's desk.

1286
01:23:40,588 --> 01:23:42,349
God, how I wish
he was still alive

1287
01:23:42,373 --> 01:23:44,157
so I could kill him.

1288
01:23:46,377 --> 01:23:48,248
Stop picking your face.

1289
01:23:51,164 --> 01:23:53,925
Why does Wallace Westwyld
look nervous as a burning cat?

1290
01:23:53,949 --> 01:23:55,255
What have you done to the man?

1291
01:23:56,082 --> 01:23:58,041
Mm, I wouldn't know, Mother.

1292
01:23:58,998 --> 01:24:00,410
Well, he's there to protect you

1293
01:24:00,434 --> 01:24:01,435
if you'll let him.

1294
01:24:05,091 --> 01:24:07,765
You're a good looking kid.
You really are. You know that?

1295
01:24:09,356 --> 01:24:10,357
What does that mean?

1296
01:24:12,403 --> 01:24:16,165
It means that God doesn't give
with both hands.

1297
01:24:16,189 --> 01:24:18,428
Uh, okay.
I love you too, Mom.

1298
01:24:18,452 --> 01:24:20,039
Hm.

1299
01:24:20,063 --> 01:24:21,629
Gotta go run the free world.

1300
01:24:22,413 --> 01:24:23,544
Don't burn it down.

1301
01:24:30,508 --> 01:24:32,094
Fucking fantastic!

1302
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:41,140
Wiley, look.

1303
01:25:42,232 --> 01:25:44,079
Oh, shit.

1304
01:25:44,103 --> 01:25:46,063
Danforth looks like
she wants to throw up.

1305
01:25:46,366 --> 01:25:48,629
Look at her body language.
Bad vibes.

1306
01:25:50,022 --> 01:25:51,371
She got caught riding dirty.

1307
01:25:52,807 --> 01:25:54,113
What have we done?

1308
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:57,179
Are you, uh, fucking
with crypto at all, right now?

1309
01:25:57,203 --> 01:25:58,378
It's gonna pop.

1310
01:25:58,813 --> 01:26:01,052
They're minting next week,
so just hit me up on Insta.

1311
01:26:01,076 --> 01:26:02,837
- Okay.
- I'll connect your wallet.

1312
01:26:02,861 --> 01:26:04,621
- May I borrow my son?
- Of course.

1313
01:26:04,645 --> 01:26:06,125
Speak to you a moment
in private?

1314
01:26:08,345 --> 01:26:09,236
Sorry.

1315
01:26:12,436 --> 01:26:13,891
Uh, who's this?

1316
01:26:13,915 --> 01:26:15,850
Jackson Prigg.
He's number two at the FBI.

1317
01:26:15,874 --> 01:26:17,199
Have a seat.

1318
01:26:17,223 --> 01:26:18,896
Uh, I'm cool. I'll stand.
What is this, like,

1319
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,768
an ambush or something?
This feels weird. I don't like it.

1320
01:26:20,792 --> 01:26:22,097
No, you'll sit.

1321
01:26:25,362 --> 01:26:26,537
I'll sit.

1322
01:26:30,367 --> 01:26:31,561
Kelly, would you
give us a moment?

1323
01:26:31,585 --> 01:26:33,172
It's okay, ma'am.
I can take notes.

1324
01:26:33,196 --> 01:26:34,675
I need you to step outside.

1325
01:26:43,206 --> 01:26:46,185
The deputy director
has flagged his, uh, concerns

1326
01:26:46,209 --> 01:26:47,664
about some uncomfortable things

1327
01:26:47,688 --> 01:26:49,212
happening inside
the family company.

1328
01:26:49,864 --> 01:26:51,668
Like what?

1329
01:26:51,692 --> 01:26:52,713
Uncomfortable things about

1330
01:26:52,737 --> 01:26:54,260
the source of my campaign funds.

1331
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:57,568
Sounds serious. What's up?

1332
01:26:58,786 --> 01:27:00,135
Deputy Director.

1333
01:27:00,614 --> 01:27:04,444
Mr. Danforth, are you familiar
with, uh, United Data Group?

1334
01:27:05,837 --> 01:27:07,708
United Data Group.

1335
01:27:08,361 --> 01:27:11,035
Yeah. Yeah, I, uh...

1336
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,105
I invested in that.

1337
01:27:13,758 --> 01:27:14,952
I invest everywhere.

1338
01:27:14,976 --> 01:27:16,476
I mean, there's...
It's everywhere.

1339
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,304
- It's very diverse.
- Uh-huh.

1340
01:27:18,328 --> 01:27:21,200
How about, uh, Nine Star United?

1341
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:25,789
Yeah, that was, uh...

1342
01:27:25,813 --> 01:27:28,314
that's more of, like,
a consulting type role.

1343
01:27:28,338 --> 01:27:30,533
It's block chain issues.
And you probably...

1344
01:27:30,557 --> 01:27:33,144
I don't want to bore you
with all that.

1345
01:27:34,605 --> 01:27:38,062
What do you know
about a classified algorithmic

1346
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:39,542
data mining software package

1347
01:27:39,566 --> 01:27:42,003
developed by
the intelligence community?

1348
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:57,236
He's here.

1349
01:27:58,193 --> 01:28:00,084
All stations, target's
in the building. East wing.

1350
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:01,608
<i>Give me everything you got.</i>

1351
01:28:01,632 --> 01:28:02,720
He's in the house!

1352
01:28:03,373 --> 01:28:05,307
Assault team, saddle up!

1353
01:28:05,331 --> 01:28:06,787
Let's move, boys!
Get a move on!

1354
01:28:06,811 --> 01:28:08,310
Let's move! Come on!

1355
01:28:08,334 --> 01:28:10,554
- Go! Come on. Move!
- Go! Go!

1356
01:28:11,816 --> 01:28:13,707
Break-break!
Package is in the house!

1357
01:28:13,731 --> 01:28:15,535
Level three, side four.

1358
01:28:15,559 --> 01:28:18,344
Blue over blue, you see him,
you fucking get him!

1359
01:28:18,953 --> 01:28:21,478
Hey!
Put your fucking hands up.

1360
01:28:23,436 --> 01:28:25,220
Now turn the fuck around.

1361
01:28:29,703 --> 01:28:31,488
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

1362
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:35,772
He's outside.
Target's outside.

1363
01:28:35,796 --> 01:28:37,296
Move! Move!

1364
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,993
Let's get this fucking guy!

1365
01:28:39,017 --> 01:28:40,647
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, killer. You see him?

1366
01:28:40,671 --> 01:28:43,040
Negative.

1367
01:28:43,064 --> 01:28:44,433
- Clay!
- That's right.

1368
01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:49,438
That's right.
Now, on your knees!

1369
01:28:49,462 --> 01:28:51,203
On your knees!

1370
01:28:52,291 --> 01:28:54,511
Lace your fingers
behind your head.

1371
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:00,797
Down on your knees now!

1372
01:29:00,821 --> 01:29:02,127
Do it now!

1373
01:29:07,611 --> 01:29:10,962
Beekeeper, huh?
God's right hand?

1374
01:29:11,484 --> 01:29:12,592
You aren't shit.

1375
01:29:12,616 --> 01:29:13,767
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1376
01:29:13,791 --> 01:29:14,991
Hey,
take a step back.

1377
01:29:15,662 --> 01:29:17,597
I'm putting this asshole's
brains on the lawn.

1378
01:29:17,621 --> 01:29:19,468
What are you doing?
He's not even armed.

1379
01:29:19,492 --> 01:29:21,601
Armed?

1380
01:29:21,625 --> 01:29:23,559
As long as this motherfucker's
breathing, he's armed.

1381
01:29:23,583 --> 01:29:25,803
You're not fucking
executing him.

1382
01:29:26,281 --> 01:29:27,979
Nice crowd you're rolling with.

1383
01:29:35,595 --> 01:29:36,770
Watch me.

1384
01:29:37,902 --> 01:29:39,251
V, what the fuck is going on?

1385
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:42,036
To "bee" or not to "bee"?

1386
01:29:42,428 --> 01:29:44,517
Isn't that the bloody question?

1387
01:29:45,518 --> 01:29:46,737
I think I'll take

1388
01:29:47,738 --> 01:29:49,150
to "bee."

1389
01:29:59,445 --> 01:30:01,162
- Wiley?
- Yeah, you good?

1390
01:30:01,186 --> 01:30:02,230
- Yeah.
- Go.

1391
01:30:04,755 --> 01:30:06,452
Get off me!

1392
01:30:07,845 --> 01:30:09,324
He's fucking mine!

1393
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:12,042
Talk to me, people.
I need news.

1394
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:22,531
He's here!

1395
01:30:22,555 --> 01:30:24,383
Go! Go! All stations!

1396
01:30:27,299 --> 01:30:29,451
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1397
01:30:33,958 --> 01:30:35,152
Go with the flow.

1398
01:30:35,176 --> 01:30:36,632
Not clear.
He's not clear.

1399
01:30:36,656 --> 01:30:37,894
Hang tight.

1400
01:30:37,918 --> 01:30:39,137
On me.

1401
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:01,246
Get on the ground.
Get on the ground.

1402
01:31:04,031 --> 01:31:06,445
You understand you did this, right?

1403
01:31:06,469 --> 01:31:07,818
You broke the rules.

1404
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:10,144
You corrupted an imperfect
but functioning system.

1405
01:31:10,168 --> 01:31:12,233
I was just trying
to get you into office, Mom.

1406
01:31:12,257 --> 01:31:13,756
How else do you think
you got elected?

1407
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:15,540
I was going to win
with or without your help.

1408
01:31:16,043 --> 01:31:19,327
We were already rich.
Your father built an empire.

1409
01:31:19,351 --> 01:31:20,937
Yeah. And you were going
to fucking

1410
01:31:20,961 --> 01:31:22,809
break it up into pieces
and sell it off.

1411
01:31:22,833 --> 01:31:24,288
Well, in the name
of public service

1412
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:26,943
because I care and I want
to leave a better world.

1413
01:31:26,967 --> 01:31:28,118
Okay. Right.

1414
01:31:28,142 --> 01:31:29,859
Yeah, because you hate the fact

1415
01:31:29,883 --> 01:31:31,252
that being the president

1416
01:31:31,276 --> 01:31:32,775
is just like
an endless cocktail party.

1417
01:31:32,799 --> 01:31:34,168
You realize that you were behind

1418
01:31:34,192 --> 01:31:35,952
in 15 of 20 counties
you needed to win.

1419
01:31:35,976 --> 01:31:37,606
15 of 20 counties!

1420
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:40,609
I taught CIA software
to hunt money

1421
01:31:40,633 --> 01:31:41,895
and not terrorists.

1422
01:31:43,506 --> 01:31:44,811
You didn't hear that.

1423
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:00,281
You got elected because of me,
and you know that.

1424
01:32:00,305 --> 01:32:02,675
Yeah, I know it.
Everyone knows it.

1425
01:32:02,699 --> 01:32:04,111
Now I know
where the money came from...

1426
01:32:05,223 --> 01:32:06,592
...and all the people
you hurt.

1427
01:32:06,616 --> 01:32:08,507
Okay, whatever.
It's computer data, Mom.

1428
01:32:08,531 --> 01:32:10,509
Somebody in this family has
to have their fucking feet

1429
01:32:10,533 --> 01:32:12,554
on the ground to actually get
shit done. You understand that?

1430
01:32:28,594 --> 01:32:32,555
Mom, the wolves are
at the fucking door right now.

1431
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,600
What are you going to do
to fix this?

1432
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:39,431
Tell the truth.

1433
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,802
The fucking...

1434
01:32:42,826 --> 01:32:44,630
What does that even mean?

1435
01:32:44,654 --> 01:32:46,675
What does that even mean,
tell the fucking truth?

1436
01:32:46,699 --> 01:32:47,937
You have an entire building

1437
01:32:47,961 --> 01:32:49,417
full of PR people

1438
01:32:49,441 --> 01:32:51,288
that are going to choose
the right way forward.

1439
01:32:51,312 --> 01:32:53,160
That guy who's coming
to kill us, that Beekeeper,

1440
01:32:53,184 --> 01:32:56,032
I'm telling him the truth
about what you did, Derek.

1441
01:32:56,056 --> 01:32:57,730
Then I'm telling
the entire nation.

1442
01:32:57,754 --> 01:32:59,625
And if it costs me everything,

1443
01:33:00,017 --> 01:33:01,496
well, so be it.

1444
01:34:15,092 --> 01:34:16,397
You fucking git!

1445
01:34:22,621 --> 01:34:23,622
Fuck!

1446
01:34:28,671 --> 01:34:30,150
You're just a man.

1447
01:34:30,716 --> 01:34:32,041
I know.

1448
01:35:25,118 --> 01:35:27,251
Thank you.

1449
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:04,810
Jesus. Looks like
a tornado came through here.

1450
01:36:10,685 --> 01:36:12,054
What's your plan here, huh?

1451
01:36:12,078 --> 01:36:13,577
You're going to tell this guy
the fucking truth

1452
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:15,318
and hope that he spares you
and kills me instead?

1453
01:36:15,342 --> 01:36:16,580
No, Derek,
I'll tell him the truth

1454
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:17,736
because it's the truth.

1455
01:36:27,877 --> 01:36:30,009
It's gone far enough.
You've proved your point.

1456
01:36:31,097 --> 01:36:33,317
Beekeepers live
for the good of society.

1457
01:36:34,971 --> 01:36:36,102
I'm retired.

1458
01:36:37,408 --> 01:36:38,670
This is personal.

1459
01:36:39,802 --> 01:36:41,194
All the more reason to stop.

1460
01:36:42,935 --> 01:36:45,198
Go back. Live a quiet life.

1461
01:36:45,938 --> 01:36:47,592
Making honey for your neighbors.

1462
01:36:48,071 --> 01:36:49,289
That's all I wanted.

1463
01:36:50,508 --> 01:36:53,313
- My neighbor's dead.
- I know. I'm sorry.

1464
01:36:53,337 --> 01:36:55,837
But do you live
in the real world

1465
01:36:55,861 --> 01:36:57,515
or just protect it?

1466
01:37:00,910 --> 01:37:02,191
What does it matter to you

1467
01:37:02,215 --> 01:37:04,846
how presidents
come to be elected?

1468
01:37:04,870 --> 01:37:07,090
- Hm?
- It doesn't.

1469
01:37:07,699 --> 01:37:09,266
What does matter to you?

1470
01:37:10,136 --> 01:37:11,181
Right and wrong.

1471
01:37:12,356 --> 01:37:13,574
It's not fashionable.

1472
01:37:14,837 --> 01:37:16,379
I believe there's good
in the universe.

1473
01:37:16,403 --> 01:37:20,581
Yeah, well, we agree.
I mean, that's my view.

1474
01:37:21,844 --> 01:37:23,846
Until the Danforth family
bought you.

1475
01:37:24,411 --> 01:37:26,239
- Ah.
- You can stop pretending.

1476
01:37:27,588 --> 01:37:30,026
We wouldn't need Beekeepers
if it wasn't for men like you.

1477
01:37:30,635 --> 01:37:32,091
Don't do that.

1478
01:37:32,115 --> 01:37:33,309
Sir, you might want
to step back.

1479
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:34,639
No.

1480
01:37:35,074 --> 01:37:37,226
- I don't want you to get hurt.
- I'm sorry. I can't do that.

1481
01:37:38,948 --> 01:37:40,079
Now, have a seat.

1482
01:37:44,301 --> 01:37:47,541
Nah, fuck the truth, man.
The truth...

1483
01:37:47,565 --> 01:37:48,890
- Wait. You put that down.
- No, Derek.

1484
01:37:48,914 --> 01:37:50,263
...comes out
of your fucking...

1485
01:37:51,612 --> 01:37:52,851
Jesus Christ!

1486
01:37:52,875 --> 01:37:54,026
That's fucking real right there.

1487
01:38:07,193 --> 01:38:08,753
- Clay, no!
- Drop your weapon. Drop it!

1488
01:38:25,516 --> 01:38:27,213
You decide who you work for.

1489
01:38:29,563 --> 01:38:30,651
For the law

1490
01:38:32,436 --> 01:38:33,916
or for justice.

1491
01:38:37,093 --> 01:38:38,181
Fuck this.

1492
01:38:38,616 --> 01:38:39,616
Bye, Mom.

1493
01:38:46,189 --> 01:38:47,993
- Go! Go!
- Move. Move.

1494
01:38:48,017 --> 01:38:49,820
- Move it out. Out of the way.
- You're okay.

1495
01:38:49,844 --> 01:38:52,891
- I got you. I got you.
- No. No. I want my...

1496
01:38:54,371 --> 01:38:55,415
Clay!

1497
01:38:58,897 --> 01:39:00,097
Come with us right now!

1498
01:39:01,073 --> 01:39:04,183
- No! I want my... I want my...
- Back away. Back away.

1499
01:39:04,207 --> 01:39:05,706
No!

1500
01:39:05,730 --> 01:39:07,360
You need to come
with me. Come on.

1501
01:39:07,384 --> 01:39:09,081
- No!
- Move out. Move out.

1502
01:39:10,169 --> 01:39:12,365
- Give me your hand. Come on!
- No!

1503
01:39:25,358 --> 01:39:26,838
Goodbye, Adam Clay.

1504
01:39:27,665 --> 01:39:29,972
Keep eyes on! Let's go!
